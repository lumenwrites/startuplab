There are different kinds of software for different purposes.

There’s keyword research tools, rank tracking tools, competition analysis tools,
backlink building tools, on page SEO plugins, etc.

Most of them have free tiers that you can use for free, and if you’re doing SEO
just for one website, it’s most likely that you will not need to pay for any of
them:

* Use google’s keyword tool + common sense for keyword research(and you can look
up 2 promising keywords per day for free with
[KWFinder](https://app.kwfinder.com/)).
* Use [Majestic](https://majestic.com/) and
[Moz](https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/) for competition analysis.
* Use [ProRankTracker](https://proranktracker.com/) for keyword tracking.
* On-page SEO is best to do manually, and then use
[SEOSiteCheckup](https://seositecheckup.com/) to make sure you’ve optimized
everything the best you could.
* For backlink building you do not need any software, it’s much more efficient to
find someone on [Freelance](https://www.freelance.com/en/) or
[Konker](http://konker.io/) to do that for you.

All of these tools offer plenty of free functionality, you absolutely do not
need “All in One” toolkit to get started, especially if you’re not offering SEO
service and just trying to rank one website. Once you see the results with free
tools — buy the premium versions for convenience as needed, or don’t.

Until then, I recommend spending most of your budget on buying backlinks and
social signals, because that’s where it matters most.
