> That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.

A scientist approached a group of people who were trying to decide between the job offers. He asked them to make a guess about which job they will probably choose, and estimate how confident they are. On average, they said they were only 66% confident in their first choice, but in reality only 1 out of 24 people ended up changing their mind and choosing a different option.

Once you can guess what your answer will be — you have probably already decided. And most of the time people can guess their answer within half a second of hearing the question. This half a second is often all the time we give ourselves to think, after that we have already jumped to the conclusion, and started rationalizing it to make ourselves feel more confident.

Humans hate changing their minds, we are horrible at it. Admitting we were wrong is painful. We respect people who profess consistent beliefs, so from political perspective it’s awful. Our natural instinct is to push new facts away, to be reluctant to accept new beliefs. We’d rather burn a guy than accept that the Earth isn’t flat if it requires admitting that we were wrong.

But admitting mistakes is also the only way we can move forward. Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement requires change. We spawn into this world as dumb babies who are wrong about most of the things, and relinquishing our beliefs the only way we can learn.

Strive to challenge your beliefs, and when the wrong belief is destroyed — celebrate, it’s not a tragedy, you’ve just became smarter.

When you get a hunch that you believe something false — don’t cling to the belief until it’s disproved beyond reasonable doubt, give it up as quickly as possible, the faster you are — the less time you’ll spend being wrong, the less bad decisions you will make.

Don’t try to protect your pride by saying that the false belief was “sort of true”, or “true in principle”. And be extra suspicious about all of the beliefs that came from that belief — what are the odds that you came to the right conclusions based on a false premise?

Sometimes people just make mistakes. The best thing you can do when you’ve realized that you did — say “whoops”, drop your belief, and move on.
