&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; is the new social media platform, a decentralized alternative to Twitter that is currently blowing up. This is a step by step guide on how to run your own Mastodon instance on &lt;a href="http://digitalocean.com"&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set up a Droplet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new docker droplet:
&lt;img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymestalez/django-react-blog/master/assets/docker-droplet.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This droplet has almost everything we will need preinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will receive an email from DO with the credentials you can use to log in to start setting up the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect to the server as a root user, using ip and password from the email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ssh root@[ip-from-email]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You will be prompted to change the default password, so do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then create a new user with the username you like, and grant him the sudo powers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;adduser ray
gpasswd -a ray sudo
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Connect domain name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's also immediately point your domain name to the droplet …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/deploying-mastodon/mastodon.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Set up a Droplet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new docker droplet:
&lt;img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymestalez/django-react-blog/master/assets/docker-droplet.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This droplet has almost everything we will need preinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will receive an email from DO with the credentials you can use to log in to start setting up the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect to the server as a root user, using ip and password from the email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ssh root@[ip-from-email]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You will be prompted to change the default password, so do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then create a new user with the username you like, and grant him the sudo powers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;adduser ray
gpasswd -a ray sudo
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Connect domain name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's also immediately point your domain name to the droplet. After buying the domain(I recommend using &lt;a href="http://namecheap.com"&gt;namecheap&lt;/a&gt;), change the Custom DNS settings to look like this:
&lt;img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/FxKpsob.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in DO's networking tab, create a domain, and add an A record pointing to the droplet:
&lt;img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/AJppAHP.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you will be able to ssh into your server using your new username and a domain name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ssh ray@hackertribe.io
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Install and configure basic stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update and upgrade all the software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Install nginx(we'll use it to serve our droplet on the right port), and your favorite text editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install nginx emacs
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now let's add docker to the sudo group, that will allow us to run all the docker commands without sudo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo service docker restart
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Clone and configure Mastodon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone the repo and cd into it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git clone https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon.git
cd mastodon
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now let's configure some settings.  First, rename the file &lt;code&gt;.env.production.sample&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;.env.production&lt;/code&gt; and open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the database username/password settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;DB_USER=your_username
DB_NAME=your_databasename
DB_PASS=your_password
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Set your domain name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;LOCAL_DOMAIN=hackertribe.io
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And enable https:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;LOCAL_HTTPS=true
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;docker-compose run --rm web rake secret&lt;/code&gt; to generate PAPERCLIP_SECRET, SECRET_KEY_BASE, and OTP_SECRET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configure the email server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;a href="https://sendgrid.com/"&gt;SendGrid&lt;/a&gt; account, go to Settings &amp;gt; API Keys, and generate an API key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then set up the config like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SMTP_SERVER=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_LOGIN=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD=
SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=youremail@gmail.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(for SMTP_LOGIN literally just use &amp;quot;apikey&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configure the site info&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the file &lt;code&gt;/mastodon/config/settings.yml&lt;/code&gt;, and enter the information about your instance(title, description, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build the containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can build the containers, we need to add a swap file, without it my $10/month droplet was running out of memory during the build process. To add swap, execute these commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(you can read more in depth about it &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's finally build our containers! (It will take a few minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(the -d flag means that we want to run it in the background mode. You can try running it without this flag, and you will see the log of everything that's going on on the screen)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create the DB and migrate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to run several commands in the db container to create the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSH into the container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker exec -i -t mastodon_db_1  /bin/bash
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Switch to the postgres user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;su - postgres
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Create a user for your db(use the username and password you've just set in the .env.production)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;createuser -P your_username
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Create a database, giving the ownership rights to the user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;createdb your_databasename -O your_username
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now you can get back to your own user, and run the migrations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker-compose run --rm web rails db:migrate
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Precompile assets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can precompile the assets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker-compose run --rm web rails assets:precompile
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After this has finished, restart the containers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; docker-compose up -d
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now your mastodon instance will run on yourdomain.com:3000!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up nginx and SSL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, follow &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; to generate SSL keys and set up the basic nginx configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, because the docker containers are serving the application on the port 3000, we will need to use nginx to proxy all the requests to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the file &lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mastodon_nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt;, and copy the settings from &lt;a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/docs/Running-Mastodon/Production-guide.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after you restart nginx:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It will serve your Mastodon instance! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations =) Create an account, test things, and invite some people to use your instance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recommend submitting a link to your instance to &lt;a href="https://instances.mastodon.xyz"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier for people to discover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you win the amount of money that it will choose. If it hits a negative number you owe me that much. Should you play or not?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of problem you are solving every time you are trying to decide whether or not to take any risky action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to figuring out whether the action has a positive or negative value to you, so called Expected Utility, whether it’s benefits outweigh the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out the answer, you need to know the sum of all the potential benefits multiplied by their probability, and compare it to the benefits and probability of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first we estimate probabilities of each outcome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1520/1*ubAzVyTA-iWcX-FkG1gDag.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we calculate our upside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; $20 * 0.3 + $15 * 0.2 + $5 * 0.2 = $10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the downside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; -$10 * 0.2 - $30 * 0.1 = -$5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we can see that the expected utility of playing this game is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; $10 - $5 = $5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know that if you play this game many times, on average, you will be making $5 every game, so that’s a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very useful concept, because when you think like that about every action you take, you end up making much better decisions. You don’t take dumb risks, and you don’t miss great opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we need to make decisions under uncertainty. When you know your values, and take actions with maximum expected utility, you can take the optimal way towards achieving your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>What is Recursion?</title><link href="/post/recursion" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-09-17:/post/recursion</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1520/1*NXs4iBMjyXG-4Zekq-wKHQ.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Recursion?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recursion simply means “self reference”. When something refers to itself or describes itself, it is called recursive.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1520/1*NXs4iBMjyXG-4Zekq-wKHQ.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Recursion?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recursion simply means “self reference”. When something refers to itself or describes itself, it is called recursive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example
&amp;gt; “This sentence is recursive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is recursive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture is also recursive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1520/1*bMBCjV1dBypkbHOwSZMtpA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In programming, recursive function is a function that calls itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you and your friends have ordered pizza, and now you want to cut it into equal slices. To do that you cut it in half, then you cut the resulting slices in half, and keep going until there’s enough slices for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In code, it would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;def slice_pizza(number_of_friends, number_of_slices):
    # Cut pizza in half
    number_of_slices = number_of_slices*2

    # Is there enough slices for everybody?
    if number_of_slices &amp;amp;gt;= number_of_friends:
        # If yes - return our slices, it&amp;#39;s time to eat pizza!
        return number_of_slices
    else:
        # If not - then cut it in half once again.
        return slice_pizza(number_of_friends, number_of_slices)


print(slice_pizza(15, 1))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This function takes the number of friends in the room(15), and a number of slices of pizza(initially 1). It cuts pizza in half:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;number_of_slices = number_of_slices*2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and checks if there’s enough of the slices now. If yes — it just returns the number of resulting slices, if not — it calls itself again, to cut the pizza in half one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recursive functions can be hard to think about, but there’s a whole class of problems in Computer Science that are much easier solved by using this kind of algorithms. For example it can be used for binary search, for finding a factorial of a number, or for creating a system of nested comments like on reddit.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Setting up SSL with nginx on Ubuntu server</title><link href="/post/setting-up-ssl" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-09-17:/post/setting-up-ssl</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/ssl2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/ssl2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time I've procrastinated to learn how to properly configure HTTPS. Turns out it is super easy. This is my simple step by step guide.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Generate certificates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make sure that your nginx config can serve files from &lt;code&gt;/var/www/html&lt;/code&gt; - it should work by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then install certbot - it is a script that will place some files into your &lt;code&gt;/var/www/html&lt;/code&gt;, and then use them to verify that you have the ssh access to the server, which proves that you are the domain owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot   
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now you can use this script to generate your certificates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/html -d yourdomain.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will create a file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a file that you're going to use to prove people that you're all good and not an evil hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also want to run a script that generates something called &amp;quot;Diffie-Hellman Group&amp;quot; - some sort of fancy security thingy that makes your SSL more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will create a file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which you will serve along with SSL certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create configuration snippets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you want to create two nginx configuration snippets - bits of config that will properly configure nginx and tell it where to find your certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First create a file &lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-yourdomain.com.conf&lt;/code&gt;, with this content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It will tell nginx where your certificates are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then create a second file &lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;add_header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Strict-Transport-Security&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;max-age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;63072000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;includeSubdomains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;preload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;add_header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Strict-Transport-Security&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;max-age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;63072000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;includeSubdomains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;quot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;add_header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;X-Frame-Options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;DENY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;add_header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;X-Content-Type-Options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nosniff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ssl_dhparam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;certs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;dhparam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;pem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It will properly configure SSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configure yoursite_nginx.conf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you want nginx to take all the requests coming to your website, and redirect them to https with properly configured SSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just create or modify the file &lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yoursite_nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt; to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;                              
        &lt;span class="err"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;default_server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;default_server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="err"&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;yourdomain.com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;www.yourdomain.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="err"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;301&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request_uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;yourdomain.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;                                             
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;443&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;http2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;default_server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;443&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;default_server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;snippets/ssl-yourdomain.com.conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;snippets/ssl-params.conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;.....&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;goes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;config.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;       
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first block of code will redirect all the http traffic to https, and the second will load the snippets you've created to configure ssl and serve the certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all you need to do is restart nginx:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and your site will be served over https! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, you can arbitrage not just products, but also information, knowledge, skill, or even human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say you have met two amazing people who don't know each other. When you introduce them to each other, you generate a massive amount of value for both of them essentially out of nothing - you have given each of them a gift of knowing someone great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example, is arbitraging information. Eliezer Yudkowsky have learned a lot about rationality and human biases from the books he has read, and then parlayed it into his blog, and later a Harry Potter fanfiction - and that has generated a huge amount of value to the people on the internet, who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I figured out that you can take the essays he wrote, and produce short entertaining videos out of them - that way you are exposing the same ideas to a whole new audience, and that, again, generates huge amounts of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also arbitrage skills. That simply means applying good ideas you have learned in one field to a completely different one. I'm constantly applying the skills and ideas I've learned as a 3D artist to my programming process, and, surprisingly, the ideas I've learned from programming are making me a much better artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an unexpected idea that I have discovered, is that you can arbitrage fiction tropes. You can take a trope you have seen in one story, apply it to a completely different genre, and it will create a new and interesting idea. You can take a scifi trope and set it in a fantasy world, or you can take a plot structure from a dramatic tv show and use it in your comedy script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart ideas are often universal. Learn a mental pattern in one field - and apply it elsewhere. Now that I got pretty good at it, every time I have an epiphany in one of my crafts, I intentionally go through each of the other fields I'm interested in and apply it there.  This has helped me to generate a lot of very interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Full-Stack Web Development - the Complete Roadmap</title><link href="/post/fullstack-web-development-roadmap" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-18T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-08-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-08-18:/post/fullstack-web-development-roadmap</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning web development is a huge advantage for a founder, even understanding
the basics will be extremely useful. This post will give you a high-level
overview of everything you need to learn, a roadmap for getting started, and a
collection of the best resources you can use to learn quickly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am going to tell you everything a professional full-stack web developer needs
to know, but if you’re only interested in understanding the basics — you can
stop reading after “Domain names and Hosting” section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Foundations (HTML/CSS/JS)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to begin is by learning the 3 main technologies all websites are
made of. HTML defines the content of a website, CSS specifies how it
looks(fonts/colors/images/etc), and JavaScript allows you to dynamically
manipulate elements(everything interactive you see on the internet was made
using JS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-2-html-js-css.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn the basics is to go through &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"&gt;The Web Developer Bootcamp on
Udemy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take you through the process of creating your first website, and give
you a great place to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frameworks are tools that allow you to implement all the common functionality
much faster and easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend using frameworks as early as possible, because they will enable you
to get results much faster, and at the same time will teach you the best
practices in a very natural and intuitive way. Just by using frameworks, you
will absorb a huge amount of knowledge incredibly quickly, and avoid wasting
time on anything unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In web development, there’s always an enormous amount of technologies to choose
from, and that choice can often be difficult for the novice. For the rest of the
article I will spare you the confusion, and instead of listing pros and cons of
every option, I’ll just tell you the best things to use based on my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-3-responsive.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to get started is learning &lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt;. These
are by far the most popular frameworks that are used by the vast majority of the
websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt; is a CSS framework, that gives you a bunch of easily customizable
interface elements, and allows you to create responsive websites very quickly
(responsive means they look well on mobile devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap has recently released the new version, and you can get started with it
by following &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/"&gt;this course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt; is a JavaScript framework, that significantly simplifies the way you
manipulate webpage elements. It has an enormous amount of plugins for every
conceivable purpose, so whenever you need some interactive element, you can be
sure you will find a way to create it with jQuery. It will also be very easy,
because StackOverflow already has solutions to 95% of the issues you will
encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-4-jquery.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn the fundamentals, you can just watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWXggB-T1jQ"&gt;this excellent
lecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the sake of completeness, I should mention
&lt;a href="http://compass-style.org/"&gt;Compass&lt;/a&gt;. You don’t need to think about it at the
very beginning, because it’s not essential for your ability to make websites,
but when you reach a point where you’re writing a lot of intermediate/advanced
CSS, and begin to find it a bit tedious, you should definitely keep it in mind.
Compass makes the process of writing CSS &lt;strong&gt;way &lt;/strong&gt;faster and more enjoyable, so
if you can invest a couple of hours into learning that, that will be one of the
best productivity boosters you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is the world’s most popular content
management system. If you are not a technical person, and are just looking to
quickly get started with making an easily customizable website — you just learn
to install and use WordPress, and that’s pretty much it, you don’t need to look
any further. It has an infinite amount of themes and plugins that will cover 90%
of your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-5-wordpress.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in becoming more of a professional web developer, and
learning to create your own custom websites, you might want to skip it and learn
a backend framework(I’ll describe them in the following sections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Domain Names and Hosting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have learned the basics and have built your first website, naturally
you want to make it available to the world. Again, in the interest of saving you
hours of research, I will not list hundreds of available options, and just tell
you the “right” things to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-6-hosting.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To buy domain names you will use &lt;a href="https://www.namecheap.com/"&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt;.
As the name implies, it has very good prices, and also an excellent user
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To host your first pages, you should use &lt;a href="https://www.bluehost.com/"&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt;,
it is cheap, very easy to use, has excellent documentation and a lot of
automated tools. It makes installing WordPress or hosting simple html pages
extremely easy, so if your goal is to get started quickly — that is exactly what
you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you will go further and gain more skill — you will need a
VPS(virtual private server). It is, to put it simply, a remote computer you have
the complete control over, and will use to serve the sites you have built with
frameworks. I highly recommend using
&lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;, it has great prices, beautiful
and intuitive interface, and I’ve been happily using it to host all of my
websites for the past 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backend Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have learned the basics, and created several simple websites using
the tools listed above, you can decide to go further, and learn how to
professionally create custom websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, the best place to begin is learning one of the backend frameworks.
Backend frameworks run on server, and dynamically generate html for a website
every time the user visits a url.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, there are dozens of options, but I will help you to narrow it down
to 3 — &lt;strong&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Node/Express&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-7-django.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opinions on which one you should learn first will differ among different
developers, but I strongly recommend you to begin with Django, and then learn
Node/Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major advantage of Django is that it is written in Python — a beautiful,
powerful language that is used in every field you can imagine, and at the same is
time the best choice for your first programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django itself is straightforward, powerful, flexible, has excellent documentation, and all
the tools you’re going to need to build 95% of the websites. More importantly —
it will give you an excellent framework for thinking about the backend code, and
understanding it is an excellent way to learn the core fundamentals of web
development in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite introduction to Django is the TutsPlus course &lt;a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/getting-started-with-django"&gt;Getting Started with Django&lt;/a&gt;, and the best way to go from a beginner to intermediate/advanced is an excellent
book &lt;a href="https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8"&gt;Two Scoops of Django&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFW_fvwCoF44MGWk74U_rFg"&gt;free youtube
tutorials&lt;/a&gt; by Mike
Hibbert’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Node and Express&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node and Express are extremely powerful tools that I recommend you to
learn after Django. They might be a bit tough for a beginner, but if you have an
understanding of Django — you will learn them very quickly and naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-8-node.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node has many advantages, and the best way to experience them is to try it for yourself. Often it will enable you to build websites much quicker than you would with Django, you will understand a lot of backend programming concepts in more depth, have an easier time building APIs, real-time webapps(like a chat or a game), and universal webapps(you'll encounter them when you will learn React). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best course I have encountered is &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2"&gt;The Complete NodeJS Developer Course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Frontend Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand HTML/CSS/JS and one backend framework, you are a capable web
developer with the power to create many kinds of websites. If you want to become
a Full-Stack developer — welcome to the world of frontend frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend frameworks will enable you to create powerful single-page applications.
At this point you’re essentially making an app that runs completely in the
browser, occasionally exchanging data with the server(like Gmail or Trello).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-9-react.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time there has been a lot of competition in this space, but as you’re
reading this article, the best choice is pretty clear — you should learn &lt;strong&gt;React
and Redux&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t go into explaining how they work or what are their advantages(it would
take a long time), but luckily, there’s an absolutely brilliant course that will
teach you everything you need to know - &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/"&gt;Modern React with Redux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to learn more advanced functionality, you can watch the 2nd part of this
course by the same author - &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/learn/v4/"&gt;Advanced React and Redux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of these courses, Stephen Grider, is an absolutely brilliant teacher,
he explains everything incredibly well, and you will have a ton of fun learning
all the complexities of these technologies by following his courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend you to create a website with Node and React/Redux, because
it will really help you to grasp how to create and use REST APIs, and combine
the whole set of technologies into a powerful and useful software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DevOps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pheew, that’s a lot of stuff. The final part of the puzzle a Full-Stack Web
Developer needs to learn is DevOps. It is a deep subject that I’m not an expert
in, but the fundamentals of deploying websites are not that hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-10-devops.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, chances are you have learned a lot of it just by building and deploying
websites. You have probably used github and some CI tool to deploy your
websites, and Nginx to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the big thing you should learn is &lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt;. Docker is an industry
standard for deploying web applications, it makes the whole process fast,
elegant and convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-11-docker.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have learned Docker from &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-tutorial-for-devops-run-docker-containers"&gt;this course&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m very happy with it. This course is short, straightforward, to the point, and easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article was useful to you. Obviously, it’s impossible to cover
everything about this deep, complex, and rapidly evolving field in one article, but
I believe that topics and resources above will give you a clear vision of the
path ahead, and a useful roadmap to follow. At least, this is the kind of
article I wish was available to me a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will certainly learn more as you follow along, and go into depth into the
topics that interest you the most, but I think that now your path will be much more
straightforward and less confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to share with you my favorite takeaways from an amazing &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14146850"&gt;Ask HN
thread&lt;/a&gt;, where technical founders
shared the most important things they have learned from building a business.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Master marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you build it they will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A developer with marketing skills can build products and achieve revenues far in
excess of their skill set. Only 20–40% of running a successful software
development business consists of developing software. A software developer with
complete code and no customers is just a software developer. A business person
with tons of customers and no software/product is in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brand, reputation, and intellectual property are 100x more valuable than
any software or technical feat. Software and technical work is relatively cheap.
It cannot be the basis of your business because someone can come in and clone
your product after you’ve done the hard work of introducing an innovative
product and establishing/educating the market. If another product has only half
of your functionality, but more substantive marketing, it’s more than enough for
them to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understand your customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies fail because they build something no one wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out who you are selling to and what problem you’re solving for them
&lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; you build anything. Forget the code, find market first. Talk to your
customers. Ideally, solve your own problem, but if you are not the target
market, you need to find a product champion who will join your team prior to the
MVP creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do not be seduced by the technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes devs don’t realize that the hardest parts of starting and growing a
business have nothing to do with code or the tech stack you choose. Marketing,
getting and retaining customers and everything else in between is way harder
than writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers don’t care about the shiny new tech, what matters is solving their
problem. Often it is much easier to do with an old and proven technology,
because new tech changes rapidly, is less stable, has less learning resources
and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on your differentiation and competitive advantages, going stock with
&lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delegate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a job application from yourself for each of the jobs.&lt;br&gt; Contemplate why
on earth you would ever hire you for the job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your time is valuable, the time you spend doing a task is the time you can’t
spend doing anything else. So focus on doing things you’re best at, and outsorce
everything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work out exactly what tasks there are in running your business that you are not
an expert at, such as accounting, sales, copy writing, etc. and hire people to
do those parts for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set revenue targets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan for profitability, set goals, and be realistic about whether you are
successfully accomplishing them. If you don’t, you might have built a good side
project, but not a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim to get your company to 10k USD monthly product revenue within three months
after launch(that’s basically a limit of ramen profitability for a small team of
2–4, plus a little bit of extra to run the business). If you can’t, then either
the product, target market or team needs to be revised drastically. It’s not a
hard goal, but it’s a great way to frame the product launch by forcing you to
ask hard questions about what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also useful as a pricing yardstick early on. If you have very few
customers, they need to be paying enough that you reach $10k almost immediately.
If your product isn’t worth that much, then you need to scale out. It’s best to
figure this out right from the start. If it feels like you can’t do $10k MRR in
three months on your own, then you need to find a cofounder who can do it
together with you… So it’s a good way to calibrate cofounder expectations as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build an MVP.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build the smallest viable version of your product and test it as early as
possible, get it in front of customers as quickly as you can and get them to pay
you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, all you need is a landing page to measure the interest. Create a static
website describing problem and the solution, with a signup, using Google Adwords
and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skip everything nonessential at the start. Focus on the key features that
customers will pay for. It will feel broken, but it’s only broken if you can’t
get any customers. When you find the right product formula and need to scale,
you’ll probably need to refactor or rewrite large parts of it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do things that don’t scale. Don’t future proof your MVP, just make it so you can
validate that your product has a market beyond your product champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other great points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being good at talking to people and networking is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good reputation and word-of-mouth is better than buying the #1 spot on
Adwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire bad clients. They aren’t worth the stress, frustration, and opportunity
cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to say “no” to feature requests that don’t fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget to take care of yourself. &lt;br&gt; It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
Sleep, exercise, eat healthy food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient. It will take longer than you think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on your process. Doing an hour of client works earns you one hour of
revenue. Improving your agency processes can earn you a large multiple of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how to sell again and again to the same customers, otherwise you will
have a high cost of customer acquisition. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t let a single customer account for more than 10% of your revenue. If that
customer leaves, you’ll be in a painful situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks will loan you money when you don’t need it and won’t loan money when you
do need it. Apply for a loan or line of credit when you’re flush with cash in
case of a rainy day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hire too quickly. Payroll + benefits can eat through profits like crazy in
a software business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build simple products that do one thing well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t take money from anyone who can’t afford to lose it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hire a ‘marketing’ firm. They will charge 10’s of thousands of dollars to
ask you questions like ‘What do you think we should do?’ and then feed it back
to you. If the product is positioned well with customers, you know more than the
marketing company ever will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failures (at least small ones) are not a problem. Failing to recover is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start now, you’ll never feel ready. Just go, learn, and repeat. Action is king.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of software for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s keyword research tools, rank tracking tools, competition analysis tools,
backlink building tools, on page SEO plugins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them have free tiers that you can use for free, and if you’re doing SEO
just for one website, it’s most likely that you will not need to pay for any of
them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of them have free tiers that you can use for free, and if you’re doing SEO
just for one website, it’s most likely that you will not need to pay for any of
them:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use google’s keyword tool + common sense for keyword research(and you can look
up 2 promising keywords per day for free with
&lt;a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/"&gt;KWFinder&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://majestic.com/"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/"&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt; for competition analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://proranktracker.com/"&gt;ProRankTracker&lt;/a&gt; for keyword tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-page SEO is best to do manually, and then use
&lt;a href="https://seositecheckup.com/"&gt;SEOSiteCheckup&lt;/a&gt; to make sure you’ve optimized
everything the best you could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For backlink building you do not need any software, it’s much more efficient to
find someone on &lt;a href="https://www.freelance.com/en/"&gt;Freelance&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://konker.io/"&gt;Konker&lt;/a&gt; to do that for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these tools offer plenty of free functionality, you absolutely do not
need “All in One” toolkit to get started, especially if you’re not offering SEO
service and just trying to rank one website. Once you see the results with free
tools — buy the premium versions for convenience as needed, or don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, I recommend spending most of your budget on buying backlinks and
social signals, because that’s where it matters most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a question I get asked very often, so I’ve decided to share my
collection of the most effective strategies that will help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold emailing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find people in your niche and personally contact them. This is the most
straightforward way to begin, finding people who are likely to need your service
and making a personalized offer is free and very effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Marketing&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Social Media&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a blog or make a YouTube channel, share free value, submit links to Hacker
News or subreddits, use your posts to advertise your service’s landing page.
This can be combined with smart PR/Influencer marketing(guest blog for people,
get people to share your content), and SEO(think about long-tail very niche
keywords that you can rank for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering as marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create open source or free software that your potential clients will want to
use, use it to drive traffic to your page. Look at
&lt;a href="https://www.draw.io/"&gt;draw.io&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://chapp.is/"&gt;chapp.is&lt;/a&gt; for a great
example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook ads may not be the best long term strategy, but they are an excellent
way to quickly test your landing page and see how well it converts. Target
audience in your niche, make an appealing ad, and spend a few buck sending
traffic to your page, it’s very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find people who already have clients, and offer them to work on projects
together(for example you can contact app designers and offer them development
services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referrals and word of mouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a chicken and the egg problem at the beginning, but after you
have your first clients, they might bring more business or recommend more
clients. Consider giving people heavy discounts at the beginning, if you think
they will bring you more business in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Alan Kay at Startup School:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus not just on problem solving, but on problem finding. You can be sure that
95% of everything we do is wrong, inefficient, and will be changed in the
future, but it’s hard to see that from now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of innovating out from the present, invent the future from the future.
Imagine the world 30 years from now. Think “Wouldn’t it be ridiculous if we
didn’t have this?”. Take this initial glimmer of an idea so far out that you
don’t have to worry how you get there. Then bring it back closer to the present,
identify an achievable and realistic step towards it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to see technology of today as the punch card machines in the 70s, and try to
replace them with Apple II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; advance something &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; important. Something worth
dedicating your life to. Pursue grand visions, not goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it is difficult, focus on milestones, not deadlines. Deadlines can be
missed, and are hard to set up realistically when you’re doing something that’s
never been done before. Milestones are inspiring to reach, and it’s more
encouraging to go from one milestone to another in pursuit of a long term goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about having the perfect batting average. Total number of successes
matters, not success/failure ratio. Failure is just overhead — an expected cost
of trying to do hard things.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of a keyword depends on how much competition there is for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if there are a lot of high authority websites spending money on SEO
for a certain keyword, you won’t be able to compete with them. That’s why you
should look for long tail keywords with low competition, but high search volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if there are a lot of high authority websites spending money on SEO
for a certain keyword, you won’t be able to compete with them. That’s why you
should look for long tail keywords with low competition, but high search volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To determine keyword’s difficulty, type it in google, and analyze the websites
you see on the first page. Use &lt;a href="https://majestic.com/"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; to look at
their most powerful backlinks, and use &lt;a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/"&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt;
to check their domain and page authority. Or you can use more expensive tools
like &lt;a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/"&gt;Kwfinder&lt;/a&gt; to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the domain of a search result has more Domain Authority than your website,
and more powerful backlinks, and the keyword you’re targeting in the title —
that means it will be difficult to compete with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s no exact match keywords in titles, or the top results have weak DA
and backlinks — that means that nobody is trying to rank for this keyword, and
you can easily do that yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love challenges and I would love to start my own online business. I’m ready to
work hard and learn. What would you advise me to study on my free time to
generate new ideas and start my own online business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/laptop-spaceship.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re serious about this — I highly recommend you to &lt;strong&gt;learn programming&lt;/strong&gt;.
It’s not impossible to start an online business without it, but you will be at a
pretty big disadvantage, unless you’re planning some purely non-technical
info-product or coaching stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with HTML, CSS, JS at a bare minimum, and if you like it — learn Django or
Node, and possibly React. Those will enable you to build your own software
products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out YCombinator &lt;strong&gt;Startup School&lt;/strong&gt; to learn the fundamentals of creating
and running a technology company. Check out &lt;strong&gt;Alex Becker&lt;/strong&gt;’s YouTube videos to
learn about SEO and Internet Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Hacker News and just hang out there, learn from the community, and be on
top of the developments in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read autobiographies&lt;/strong&gt; of awesome founders and books on how the biggest
companies were made. Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Alexis Ohanian, Amazon(The
Everything Store), Google(In the Plex), YCombinator(The Launch Pad),
Pixar(Creativity, Inc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick the top 3 books for getting started it would be “&lt;strong&gt;Start Small,
Stay Small&lt;/strong&gt;”, “&lt;strong&gt;Rework&lt;/strong&gt;”, and “&lt;strong&gt;Lean Startup&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, most importantly — just &lt;strong&gt;start building something&lt;/strong&gt;, the sooner the
better. You won’t know what you’re doing, but that’s okay, because experimenting
and seeing what works is the fastest way to learn and gain experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to reinvent the wheel, just pick a business model that already works,
copy it, and learn to make it work for you. Here’s a few ideas for getting
started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Affiliate marketing&lt;/strong&gt;. Pick a niche, create an optin, build a mailing
list, sell affiliate products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Marketing &lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt; Social Media &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; SEO&lt;/strong&gt;. Build a blog or a youtube
channel, learn to drive traffic to it, monetize it with affiliate products, try
to figure out how to make your own product to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Info Product&lt;/strong&gt; — create an ebook or a video course and try to sell it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SaaS&lt;/strong&gt; — create an online tool or an app, market it, sell it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; — pick a thing you’re good at, and offer to do it for people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical product&lt;/strong&gt; — look into shopify+ dropshipping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So choose one of these options, make your first website, dive deep, and make it
work. Good luck! =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For quite a long time I’ve been trying to develop good daily habits, and tracking my progress. I’ve been tweaking and improving my system a lot, and at this point it has pretty much stabilized, so I think it’s time to share what I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tracking I’m using a great app &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/track-share-lite-universal/id338964782?mt=8"&gt;TracknShare&lt;/a&gt;, although a simple text file worked well for me too. For tracking with text I’ve used an Emacs org-mode and it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*fiJzRMgQgTEEwu0-WG3kIg.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about the most important habits I want to develop, and ended up with this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating healthy. &lt;/strong&gt;Not a specific diet, just no unhealthy junk food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; Jogging every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity.&lt;/strong&gt; Writing fiction, nonfiction, or jokes every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming.&lt;/strong&gt; Writing some code, or learning some CS every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and later I decided to add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information diet.&lt;/strong&gt; Minimizing inane rechecking of social media, internet browsing, TV. Reading books instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diet and exercise are the most important habits for a healthy lifestyle, writing and programming are the most important skills I wanted to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I have realized that helped me a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep it simple, develop one habit at a time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s best to develop your habits one at a time, starting with the most important one. I recommend to start with a list of 4 habits or less, otherwise it gets way too overwhelming and spreads your attention, slowing down the progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrange the habits in the order of priority, and start the day by accomplishing the first, most important one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to dedicate a week or a month to one habit, then move on to the next one. Start with an exercise week, or a writing month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Have 3 grades for each habit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of simple yes or no checkboxes, TracknShare allows to select different “grades” for each habit. After some experimentation, I have found that having 3 grades works best for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wY5QLXRgOxYzl4Blh712eg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are just getting started, it’s best to aim for the minimal, most basic version of the habit, just the action necessary to sustain it and keep thinking about it every day. This should be something you can’t fail at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days of successfully maintaining the bare minimum level, or when you are feeling inspired, you can strive to do more and accomplish the more challenging version of a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example for sport the minimal version would be “Do any sort of exercise of any kind”, and the excellent version would be “Go for a run in the park and run a certain distance”. For programming the minimal version is “Write a few lines of code of code of any kind, and commit them to github”, and excellent version is “Make progress with my AI projects”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you get better, the excellent versions of habit become normal, and you can set new challenges for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It’s okay to fail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing habits is hard, and you want it to be, because you want to set challenging and ambitious goals that make significant improvements in your life. If you succeed on the first try, you have probably set a goal that’s way too easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you will fail, and it’s okay. I’ve been trying to develop my habits for years and I still often fail, nevertheless I see a massive improvement. Don’t beat yourself up, even if you have been failing for a long time — just keep tracking and strive to improve whenever you can. Sometimes it takes months to see the progress, sometimes you relapse into the old patterns, but as you look back you can clearly see a good trend, a solid improvement, and it’s extremely satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters is not never failing, but getting back on top of your habits quickly once you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you keep failing — redefine the success. Start with a ridiculously simple, minimal version of your habit that you can’t fail to accomplish. Once you succeed with it for long enough — step up your challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain loves optimizing for achieving clearly established goals, every time you successfully accomplish your habit your brain receives some reinforcement, and you get better. Every time you fail it receives negative reinforcement, so this works in your favor either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Streaks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer you successfully maintain the habit, the longer your “streak” is, the more motivated you are to keep it going. So a nice visual representation is extremely helpful to keep up your motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Habits vs Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits are like loops that you keep repeating every day, that’s their power, but it can also be a flaw. If you want to keep moving forward — you don’t want to keep doing the same thing over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes after successfully maintaining your habits for a few days you start feeling like you are stagnating, and you may lose your motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why it’s important to set goals and new challenges, keep improving, and making sure that your habits don’t just maintain your existing skills, but keep moving you further towards your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some habits are okay to keep on a loop, for example I’m happy with the level of exercise I’m getting right now, and I don’t care to improve, as long as it keeps me healthy I just want to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand to make progress in writing, just writing a certain number of words per day is not enough. You need to intelligently set challenges, try to craft longer, more interesting and elaborate stories, etc. You want to set goals and apply principles of deliberate practice, just repeating the same thing over and over again isn’t enough to make you better.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Anchoring Bias</title><link href="/post/anchoring-bias" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-23T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-07-23:/post/anchoring-bias</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;People rely too heavily on the piece of information that they have received first.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*OzzD7O4yEUaCadcM4XBrsw.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say I spin a wheel, with numbers ranging from 1 to 100. Then I ask you to guess a number of countries in Africa. Turns out, statistically, your answer will be much lower if the wheel has showed number 16 than if the wheel would have showed 87. Why would that happen? The number is clearly random and has nothing to do with the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, even when presented with the clearly false information, your mind will use it as an “anchor” — a starting point you will use to make a guess. Then you then “slide” up or down from that anchor, until the result seems reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People rely too heavily on the piece of information that they have received first. They use it to form the initial guess, and then make incremental adjustments based on additional information, but that is usually not enough, and the initial random anchor keeps a lot of influence over future decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often that leads to mistakes, and people who know about it can use it to their advantage. For example when you’re buying a house, the salesman will first take you to the expensive house he does not expect you to buy, so that the next offer he shows you would seem mich more reasonable, even if it’s still overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get rid of this bias, the first step is to be aware of it, try to observe your thinking, and notice when instead of coming up with an independent guess, you are making adjustment from some initial anchor. Then — think about the anchor in the opposite direction. If the initial number was too large you want to think about the one thats too small, and vice versa. That should help you to come up with a more accurate estimate.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>How do you come up with startup ideas?</title><link href="/post/how-do-you-come-up-with-startup-ideas" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-22T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-07-22:/post/how-do-you-come-up-with-startup-ideas</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s my reply to a person who asked this question&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*jJ3dy-ho5lYkPADu.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my reply to a person who asked this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read PG’s essay on coming up with startup ideas (&lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"&gt;http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&lt;/a&gt;) and books on startups (Start Small Stay Small, Lean Startup, Rework, Zero to One, Abundance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Edward DeBono’s “Serious Creativity” — the most brilliant book about generating ideas I’ve ever encountered. Not about startups or apps in particular, but very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are startup ideas threads on HN: 
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9836508"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9836508&lt;/a&gt; 
and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re good at android development — please, PLEASE build a good text editor. It is the most important app for me, the first thing I look for in any new device, and all android text editors suck SO MUCH. I would easily spend 10−30 if you would build something like Editorial, that would be convenient to use on android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think if there’s something in your life that’s missing, some tool that you would like to use, and build that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that fails — think about the perfect niche, about people you like and respect, who use technology and/or could benefit from it; understand them deeply, identify their goals, problems, challenges; and build something for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that fails — look for a different not tech-related hobby. Like music or writing or woodworking or something like that. Whatever makes you the most curious. That will help you with burnout, and will give you a great niche to work in. Then identify the problems you’re facing, and solve them with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that fails — talk to other people and ask if there’s anything they might need, if there’s any problems they have, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also — check out new mobile OS’es, like Ubuntu Touch, Firefox OS, etc. These are new, emerging ecosystems, where there’s plenty of apps to build. You can simply look at the most successful iOS/Android apps, and copy them to these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are having difficulty with “finding their passion in life”, and I think that this is the result of the misconceptions they have about how this process works. In this article I want to share some ideas that helped me to understand what I want out of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You don’t find your passion, you create it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often think that there’s a magic “right” job waiting for them, and that if they find it, they’ll immediately recognize that this is what they were meant to do. Their problem is that they’re trying to judge all things in the abstract before they do them. That’s a mistake. It’s hard to predict what you’ll eventually love before doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to “find” your passion implies that in life there exists some preexisting purpose, and all you need to do is discover it. That is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling of passion is not where you start looking for your path, many people who love what they do started doing it without passion, and you are not supposed to be feeling exceptionally passionate about any activity when you begin learning. You do not have to be born with talents or passions, you can develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no inborn connection between you and some activity. You weren’t “destined” to do anything, you can do whatever you want. You pick a direction in life, make choices, set goals, pursue them, and as you go further on your path, you develop your skills and passions along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don’t start with passion, start with values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel passionate about anything — you don’t need to look for an activity that makes you feel excited right now, instead — understand what you value in life, and pursue activities that allow you to maximize your values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What impact do you want to make on the world? What kind of skills would you like to develop? What do you want to create? What do you want to be good at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You don’t have to know the ultimate answer for your life to start acting, all you need is a direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now you may not have the necessary experience and information to make the perfect choice and set the best long term goals, but it’s okay not to know your ultimate destination when you begin walking your path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t think about your goals as a lighthouse in the distance that you must travel towards, instead — think of them as a compass. Just pick the general direction you want to walk towards, and then correct the course as you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the best choice you can using the information that you have, and roll with it. Each step forward that you take enables you to see what’s in front of you more clearly, which enables you to make more accurate decisions. So make a decision now, you can always change your mind later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passion is a side effect of mastery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t follow your passion, become very good at something instead, and passion will follow you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being excited about some activity is a side effect of being good at it. Adopt the&lt;strong&gt; Craftsman mindset&lt;/strong&gt; — move your focus away from finding the right work and towards mastering your craft, and the passion will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What one man can do another man can do. There’s no gene for being a great writer, doctor, artist, pilot, or whatever. If some activity works for someone else — then it can work for you too, you can develop your passion just like any other skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion is not some mystical power that only chosen ones possess, it’s just that passionate people are doing(maybe unconsciously) something right. If you haven’t “found your passion” yet it simply means that for now you haven’t found the right ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If somebody does something and really enjoys it — it means that you can replicate it and enjoy this thing as well. Try to understand what passionate people do right, and then consciously practice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You don’t have to feel passion 100% of the time.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are inconsistent and unreliable. When you don’t feel like doing your chosen work, instead of questioning whether or not you have “passion”, trust the decisions that you’ve made and keep working on your skill. If it is something you care about getting good at — just practice, and as you get better, you will feel passionate about it more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Align your current emotions with the goals that you’ve proactively set, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>False Dichotomy</title><link href="/post/false-dichotomy" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-06-04:/post/false-dichotomy</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Taking a complex issue and boiling it down to 2 options when there’s more alternatives available.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*aIbynppEMamCrQSqQx6enQ.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Dichotomy means taking a complex issue, and boiling it down to 2 simple mutually exclusive choices, when in reality there’s more alternatives available. To make their side look more appealing, people present nuanced arguments as black and white, or take extremes and pretend like they are the only options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thinking often leads to ignoring potential solutions, and prevents us from gaining an accurate understanding of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also leads to polarization of opinions — people treat an argument as a battle against the opposite side, and as a result take more and more extreme positions. Sometimes people are afraid to offer measured opinions because their own side will call them a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example a politician may demonize drugs and suggest longer sentences for drug addicts, because taking a more balanced view will make him look like he supports drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other examples of this fallacy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either you are with us or against us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either we improve this law or everyone will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either you go to church or you are a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either you are a republican or a democrat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome it, remember that in reality things are rarely one-sided. Most of the time complex issues have costs and benefits. Optimizing for values often requires trade offs. To get the most accurate picture, you want to see flaws and advantages of both positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you support one side of the with one group of people, doesn’t mean you have to automatically agree with everything that side says and reject the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tips on achieving the flow</title><link href="/post/flow" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-06-04:/post/flow</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Flow is an amazing state that you enter when you’re completely immersed into some activity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*m5GeSfHJOhQC_xKa.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips on achieving the flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29"&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing state that you enter when you’re completely immersed into some activity. It is a state of high consciousness and full engagement. It is the reason people are doing complicated and creative things like art and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow is one of the best experiences in life. This is what makes you passionate about what you do, you get the core happiness in your life out of doing the thing you love. It gives you full immersion, extreme productivity, nonstop energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re in the flow you’re completely focused, present, on top of your performance. You’re working at the edge of your abilities, all of your faculties are focused on one activity, your sense of time and of self dissolves, because your brain has no resources left to sustain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result you are extremely driven, and you get good at what you do fast just by naturally doing what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you achieve it? Here are the elements you need to make it work well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set clear and valuable goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you need is a simple, unambiguous goal that you value and know how to achieve, a challenge that you know how to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If what you want to do is a big and complicated task — break it down into multiple smaller ones, then breakdown the first of them into several parts again, and do that until you have an easy first step that takes 20 minutes or less to accomplish. By the way this goal setting, breaking down, and planning often IS the first easy step to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*rQBmbr9dfft3IE_0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also notice that the goal should be at the right level for you, it should be simple enough for you to feel confident and competent, yet challenging enough to be interesting. Ideally, your task should be a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit more challenging than you’re used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And make sure that what you do really matters to you. Your brain won’t engage into taking steps towards goals you don’t care about, so make it clear how valuable the goal is to you, and how the steps you’re taking bring you closer to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take your time. Don’t resist being out of state. Build momentum.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, getting into flow is like falling asleep — it takes time, it is a result of particular actions, but you can not force yourself into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not a computer, and you most likely won’t enter the state in the first 30 seconds. Usually it takes around 20 minutes, sometimes less(if task is very clear, interesting and engaging). Sometimes it can take longer, and you need to realize — it is perfectly normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being lazy and uninterested(‘out of state’) at the beginning is perfectly fine, nobody can switch into a focused mode in seconds. Just trust the process and keep going through the right steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set up a timer(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt; can be very helpful) for 20–30 minutes, and decide to completely focus on the task for this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus and Presence.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug off. Remove distractions, both external and internal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start, your mind usually tends to wander away and get distracted from the task. Realize that it’s normal, don’t beat yourself up, just gently get your attention back to the question you’re thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of focus is similar to meditation, by learning to meditate you learn to “turn off” all of the unrelated thoughts, and get into the present moment, focus on the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also — think ‘inside’ the process, don’t be ‘meta’. If you’re writing — write, if you’re painting — paint. Don’t get distracted on organizing your workspace or trying to figure out the best tools and techniques to do it. It feels productive, but it often isn’t. Don’t confuse being focused on the process itself with being focused on figuring out how it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intent + freedom from outcome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creative work, you often can not control the outcome of what you’re doing. When you’re just learning to write, code, or paint, you can not directly control how good the end result will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why it’s best not to worry about the final outcome, and focus on taking the right steps, optimizing your process, learning your skills, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_%28learning_method%29"&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/a&gt;. These are the things you can directly control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measure the results you can directly control, and gain satisfaction and rewards from that. Outcome that you get is a side effect of your actions, and you can not directly control it. Judge how well you’re doing based on your actions, not the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manage your expectations to make your emotional state go up.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy every little step forward that you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for taking steps forward be fulfilling and satisfying for you, that keeps you motivated and enjoying the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to feel happy and excited after accomplishing every task, instead of just getting tired and exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manage your expectations. Learn to enjoy taking steps forward, don’t beat yourself up, instead — pat yourself on the back for every bit of progress. That makes you more engaged and keeps you loving the process and wanting to do it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about how fast you are going, or how well you’re doing. Just taking action is all that matters and all you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do. Action and going through the process is what gets you into flow and gives you results. Consciously focus on feeling good about yourself after taking each little step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great talk on applying this principle in pick up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="flex-video youtube widescreen"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="853" height="480"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bUJdJIxgI7U?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Immediate gratification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get into the flow, you need the actions you take to feel rewarding. You need to find a way to immediately see results of your actions, to measure how well you’re doing, and receive positive reinforcement once you accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understand what you do.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t just go through the motions, this is the best state-killer. Have a clear plan, clear goal, understand each step that you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you’re in charge and in control of what’s happening. Flow is about thinking and working with your mind, solving tasks, and knowing what you do and how you’re doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to replace this by going through random motions. Realize that rushing does not makes you more effective. What makes you faster and more effective — is skill, careful and calm thinking, planning, understanding, consciously applying the principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let go of or get back to basics.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re already in the strong flow constantly checking out the principles may become a distraction. So once you’re in and it’s working — you may want to let go of the principles, and just enjoy being in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it stops working and you’re feeling like you’re falling out of the process — don’t try to bruteforce through it. Stop. Think. Look at the checklist of the main principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I have a good task?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am iI focused or distracted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I jave a crystal clear understanding of what I’m doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out what you’re not doing. Fix it. It’s not about power, it’s about simply going through the right actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my favorite principles of learning, ideas that will help you to acquire skill in the fastest and the most efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Massive action.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all — take massive action. Learning without doing — it’s like reading books about body building without ever going to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your knowledge about the subject is like a map that shows you how to get to the goal. Action — is actually moving forward and walking a way towards it.
Find a minimum of necessary knowledge to be able to start acting — and then act. Don’t procrastinate by reading tons of books before you start. You will learn all the information that you need along the way. Come up with a practical challenge, figure out the first little step that you need to take — and then take it. If you’re reading information for a good practical reason you will learn it so much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main force behind progress, this is the source of real experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deliberate practice.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and equally important principle. Deliberate practice means consciously setting challenges for yourself and solving them. Constantly pushing forward instead of just going through the repetitive motions. Always figure out how to do new things that are a little above your current level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set new challenges that are hard to accomplish, understand how to accomplish them, and then repeat it until they feel automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cultivate your passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoying what you do is crucial. You &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to love what you do to get really good, it is not optional. If you don’t love what you do — you’re doing it wrong. Getting mastery at anything is a long process, it’s a marathon, not a sprint, and you won’t get too far relying only on your will power. They say that you need 10000 hours of practice to become a pro, nobody can put so much effort into something if it’s not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also life is to short to do things that you don’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t feel a strong passion now — don’t worry. Passion is not a preexisting quality that you either have or don’t have. It is something that you can learn and develop. Look for ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thinking. Understanding first, speed and efficiency — later.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t rely on your subconsciousness. Don’t expect to get good by mindlessly doing something over and over again, without understanding how, hoping that you’re “training your subconsciousness”, hoping that mere repetition will make you better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with doing things slowly, understand each step. And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; your brain gets used to it and automates the process, which enables you to do it faster or focus on more precise details. But don’t try to skip to this part, don’t hope that you can get good without detailed understanding of how you’re doing it, understanding always comes first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*F7Hu2xLZNEt0OlDn.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn to get in the flow.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow is a state of being completely immersed in what you’re doing. When you’re in flow you’re completely focused, present, and very efficient. This state feels incredibly good, and makes you extremely productive. Read &lt;a href="https://medium.com/orange-mind/tips-on-achieving-the-flow-fea7204daaf5"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for tips on how to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consistency(is more important than speed)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting good at something is a long term task. Getting better consistently is a lot more important than getting better fast. Approach everything you do with that idea in mind. Do not rush, keep in mind the big picture. Make sure that you’re not stressing yourself out so you won’t quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care of your health. Make sure that your lifestyle is sustainable. You need to keep steady pace, you need to be able to keep doing what you’re doing years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop habits that you can do every day that will naturally lead you to where you want to be in a long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn Inner game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;activity has “outer game” — things that you do physically, your technical skills; and “inner game” — your attitudes to what you do, your mindset, everything that happens in your head while you’re doing it. Inner game is equally important, so learn it, pay attention to it. It includes your ability to focus and deal with stress, your state of mind, your emotional intelligence, your ability to focus, proactively set and accomplish goals, etc. If you’re stuck or unable to move forward — it is possible that your problem is not in knowledge or in technical execution, but in your inner game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria"&gt;SMART&lt;/a&gt; goals. Have a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is most useful way to move forward and not get lost. Reflect on your major life long-term goals, break them down into smaller ones, that you can accomplish in relatively short period of time. Breakdown smaller ones even further — you can set your weekly, your daily goals. This is amazing way to make any task manageable, to track your progress, to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will help you to be sure that you know what you do and that you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Know that you can&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ll do anything for 10 years straight — there’s no way you won’t become a master(of course, some level of brain usage required). Understand that if you won’t quit — success is inevitable. Don’t let anybody mess with your confidence, to tell you what you can’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between intelligent course-correcting and irrational fears/doubts. It’s a cliche — but “believe in yourself”. Once you have made a decision — don’t doubt it. If failing is not an option for you — you won’t fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t compare yourself to the masters and think “I’ll never be able to do this”, it will just stand in your way and waste your time. Just focus on practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tips on self-control and will power</title><link href="/post/will-power" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-06-04:/post/will-power</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How to be proactive, stay consistent and do what you think is right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*34FBGQCQNsJmVhky.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to be proactive, stay consistent and do what you think is right.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self control and being proactive is hard. Trying to follow through on your decisions is one of the biggest challenges you will face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important skills to achieve your goals and become an awesome person is being able to stay consistent, to act based on your decisions, not on the emotion you’re feeling in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the best situation is when you’re “naturally” driven to do the right thing, so you do that just because you want to. And I think you should always try to do things that way — it’s more fun and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often to make cool lifestyle easy and natural you need to implement some habits, switch your old action patterns and get used to new behaviors.
I came up with some ideas that helped me to make this process much easier. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn to distinguish rationalization from the “real” thinking. Realize that it’s not a logical issue — it’s an emotional one.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often you can spend a lot of time and energy just on deciding whether you should act the right way or “cut yourself some slack” and do what you feel like doing. For example you decided to get on the diet, and on the next day you start thinking “well, one little candy is not a big deal”, “so what, now I will never eat a cheseburger in my life? that’s not cool”, “well, coffee is kind of healthy, energy drink could make me leaner”. And you start thinking that you have logical dilemma here. At that moment you need to recognize:
&lt;em&gt;This is not a problem of logic or understanding, it’s an emotional one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationalization is a psychological tool that everybody uses every day to maintain the illusion of being in control of his actions. We think that we act based on our logic, but very often we don’t. What happens is that we act based on our feelings/emotions, and then our brain tries to &lt;em&gt;rationalize&lt;/em&gt; — logically justify these actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what you need to do — is to learn to distinguish the “real”, rational thinking, when you use reason and logic to find out what’s best for you, from rationalization — when you are basically just coming up with excuses to do what you feel like doing, excuses that look &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; similar to logic, but aren’t it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think rationally and make real decisions about diet when you’re in a comfortable, not hungry state, but if you get hungry — don’t trust your brain, what you’re thinking about has nothing to do with logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*aPNxwpH83024sW95.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good way to call this is “trusting in your higher self”. There are moments in your life when your mind is bright, sharp, alert — when you can think clearly and make the best decisions. That’s your “higher self”. And then there are moments when you’re angry/hungry/horny/lazy/sleepy/etc, when you’re in haze and out of state, when you can’t think clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make decisions when you’re in your higher self, and when you’re in the mode of lower consciousness — just trust them and don’t argue, understand that now it’s not the best time to change the plan that you’ve developed when you were much smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So — learn to distinguish true thinking from rationalizations, recognize when you’re in the lower consciousness. And once you do — realize that you don’t have the logical problem, you don’t need to “understand” anything right now, you know &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what’s the right thing. You just don’t feel like doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you don’t have doubts anymore, you trust the decisions that you’ve made when you were in the higher state, you can clearly see what you should do. And instead of dealing with understanding &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; emotion, all that’s left is to deal only with the emotion/mood, make yourself to take the right actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what’s right, and your task is clear — get yourself to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Replace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to know that whatever negative habits you having — you’re having them for a reason. They’re satisfying some of your needs, and that is good. They’re just doing it not in a way you like, for example dumb, unhealthy, or counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like TV satisfies your need for stimulation and adventure, or like crappy food satisfies your hunger and desire for salt/sugar. And you can’t just reject that need, unless you’re like 120 years old yogi, or the hulk of the will-power. So the first thing you do — find a good and healthy ways to satisfy all of your desires, that will make your life so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step of starting the diet — stuff the fridge with healthy food and fruits. First step of quitting TV — buying bunch of cool books you’ve always wanted to read. If you’re thinking about eating some junk food—the first thing to do is to eat a ton of healthy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a craving — don’t reject it, satisfy it. In a healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Direct your focus. Use meditation to direct your thoughts. Master your emotions.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment"&gt;Marshmallow experiment&lt;/a&gt;— cool experiment done by Stanford scientists. They put kids in one room with a tasty marshmallow, and told them that “I will walk away now, if you won’t eat this marshmallow in the next 15 minutes I will come back and give you another one, so you’ll have 2.″ And walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they observed how kids were trying to avoid eating the marshmellow. Turned out that the ones who succeeded did the same thing — turned away from it, found some distraction, way to stop thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand — no way in hell you will act right if you’re constantly thinking about marshmallow. This will deplete your will power in no time. If you want to do the right thing — consciously direct your focus away from thinking about doing the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn to do that — is to learn meditation. This will teach you to control your thinking, and think only the thoughts that you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will power is more emotional issue than an intellectual one. Trying to convince yourself to act right is fine, but don’t “argue” with yourself, it’s futile and only burns your will power. Stop the “thinking” about whether you should do the right thing, don’t question it, and switch to thinking about something productive as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to control your emotions, develop the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence"&gt;emotional intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, learn to feel what you want to feel at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Right associations. Pain/pleasure. Value.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re evolved to seek pleasure and to avoid pain. Our actions are controlled by the oldest and dumbest part of our brain. This thing can not do any sophisticated reasoning, it just makes you to go where it thinks the value is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it developed to help us to survive, but, especially in modern times, this mechanism is very often misfires. So — don’t associate value with wrong stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is to train your mind to associate the pain/pleasure with the right thing. Condition yourself to associate the good things with the joy of life and fulfillment, with the ultimate pleasure. And bad things with pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you associate hamburger with tasty nutrition it is almost irresistible, if you associate it with heart disease and cancer — it’s becomes lot less tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make right associations use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reframing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reframing"&gt;Reframing&lt;/a&gt; is simply looking at things from the different angle, perceiving the world differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you can reframe feeling hungry into the feeling of getting lean. You can actually learn to enjoy being hungry(to some extent), because you choose to perceive it as pleasure, as something valuable. Make a connection in your mind “I’m hungry = I’m getting prettier and healthier”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing with exercise or with work — reframe the feeling of being tired into feeling of getting stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Realize that it’s a bigger choice. Upwards/downwards cycles.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realize that this little decision affects a lot more than you think. It’s very easy to do some little thing wrong, like eat a little cookie when you decided not to, precisely because it’s “not a big deal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you need to see that in fact it’s a much bigger deal than it seems. All of your decisions and actions depend on each other, and every little step either triggers the positive chain of events, or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I ate a cookie, I might as well eat this chocolate/watch this movie/etc”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you go to the gym -&amp;gt; your self esteem grows -&amp;gt; you’re proud of yourself and inspired -&amp;gt; you decide to read a good book instead of watching tv -&amp;gt; you’re even more proud, you want to eat healthier -&amp;gt; next day you feel even better so you’re more likely to go to the gym again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you eat hamburger -&amp;gt; you feel bad, your brain works worse -&amp;gt; you’re less likely to exercise -&amp;gt; you’re even dumber and in lower state -&amp;gt; you’re less likely to do exercises and eat properly -&amp;gt; you’re more likely to eat one more hamburger -&amp;gt; you feel even shittier and dumber -&amp;gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad decisions mess with your vision of yourself, your identity as a proactive happy person, they harm all the areas of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that it’s true. Eating a little cookie is not just about consuming little amount of calories, it makes you MUCH more likely to screw up in other areas of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always be aware, every little decision triggers chains of events, so when you decide to fail in executing some “unimportant” action — you need to see how it may really fuck you over in a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So look atthe big picture. Eating a little candy is not a big deal, but you know that the fact of eating this candy will affect your self-respect, consistency, and will damage your other areas. It’s not just about a candy. It represents all the bad things in your life, shitty patterns of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the same time — see all the beautiful things, all the happiness that good decisions may lead to, even very little ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gradually build macro momentum.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="flex-video youtube widescreen"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the video above, Tyler explains this idea amazingly. See the level that you’re at, and gradually build up your powers to do more and more complicated stuff. Don’t expect to get amazing in a matter of days, take right but simple actions that will make you great in a year. Start simple and improve gradually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid micro fuckups.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idea related to previous one. It’s so easy, and so destructive to fail at little things. Learn to see the moments when you make a small wrong decisions, they’re easiest ones to miss, and they’re the ones that bring you down. When you have a great momentum going on — no way you will start screwing up with something big — you see the harm behind it too clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever starts taking drugs from heroine. When you’re doing good — you won’t just go and eat at McDonalds or get depressed, but it is very possible to gradually slide down into that. So be aware of micro-fuckups, little failures that are turning into a large trouble over time. See the pain behind them, focus on it. Pay special attention to failures that seem like “not a big deal” and don’t allow them to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identity change.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t just try to change your behaviors, try to change your identity. Instead of just developing your habits you also need to develop the right beliefs about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for you not to murder people, or to not steal, or not to do drugs — because you know that you are not “that kind of person”. You’re not prohibiting yourself to do that, you just believe that you’re not a guy who would do such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is to develop similar kind of beliefs about any kind of behavior that you want to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not the kind of person who eats shitty food”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m inspired and do what I do because I love it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not forcing myself to act right, that’s just the way I do things, because I’m awesome”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowing that you can.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your desire to do some particular activity is calculated by a simple formula:
(Perceived value, how much do you want to achieve something)*(probability of the result).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your chance to get the reward by doing certain thing is 50/50 — it means that you will have half as much motivation as you would have if you would be 100% sure of the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that the more optimistic you are, the more you believe that what you do will give you results that you want — the more motivation you will have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Know that “last time” is always a lie.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many “last times” did you have already? Saying that “I’m doing this for the last time” is always a lie. If you don’t have enough reasons to act right today — you won’t have enough reasons to do that tomorrow, in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Turn bad habits that you enjoy into reward instead of eliminating them completely.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of quitting TV forever — decide to watch an episode of your favorite show once you’ve accomplished some task. That way you won’t feel pressure of cutting something that you like out of your life completely, and at the same time — have a nice little motivation to do the productive things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make it natural.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t overestimate your will power, it can get you only so far. Strive to achieve the real joy from what you’re doing, act right because it feels good.
No tricks will keep you motivated fo a long time unless you’re doing something that “works” for you, unless you’re getting a joy out of it, at least on some level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find ways to make doing the right thing “naturally” fun and easy for you. Always look for ways to do what you love and love what you do.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Rationalization</title><link href="/post/rationalization" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-03T00:07:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-04-03T00:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-04-03:/post/rationalization</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We do whatever feels good, and then come up with explanations that make us feel better about it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You see this beautiful girl standing across the room. You would like to approach her and start a conversation, but then you think to yourself “Nah, she probably has a boyfriend. Also she wouldn’t like me anyway. Not to mention that I need to focus on studying, I don’t really have time for relationships.” So you look away, go home, play World of Warcraft, eat a pizza, feed your cats, hump your human-sized action figure of Chewbacca, go to sleep, and die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were your excuses the &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; reasons for not approaching? Imagine if you’d know with 100% certainty that you will not get rejected, would you still decide that you’d rather focus on studying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationalization&lt;/strong&gt; means coming up with seemingly logical/rational explanations for irrational behavior. We do whatever feels good, or whatever is easy/convenient/profitable, and then come up with explanations that make us feel better about our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to buy a new car. You don’t know much about the recent models, so you research, select a few options, look at their specs, make the list of pros and cons of each one. At the bottom the list, you finally write down your decison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say you’re a salesman, and your job is to sell a certain model. You take a sheet of paper, and at the bottom you write “and that’s is why this is the best car ever”. Then you do your research, compare options, and above the bottom line, you write a list of reasons why that’s the best model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not lying, all the reasons are true, but you started thinking about them after the choice has already been determined. Your answer was already either true or false before you came up with explanations, and they &lt;em&gt;could not change your choice&lt;/em&gt;. Your &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt;reason for making it was “that’s my job to sell this car”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to make a choice or belief rational even by using the smartest, most convincing arguments. The purpose of rationality is not to argue convincingly for a position, but to decide which position to argue for. Once your position is fixed, it can not become more rational. Rationality takes evidence and knowledge and looks for the best, most accurate conclusions. Rationalization runs in reverse, it starts with the conclusion and searches for reasons. If you already know your answer — thinking about it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your success is determined by how good your decisions are, and when you are rationalizing, the actual algorithm you are using to make decisions is “whatever feels good”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you defeat rationalization? First of all, it comes down to being aware of it, and being honest with yourself. Always ask — what are the &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; reasons for my beliefs/decisions/actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you eating this ice cream because “well, it has nuts in it, so it’s actually kinda healthy” or because it tastes good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you playing this computer game because “life is to be enjoyed”, and this game actually brings you joy? It is the best thing you want to do with your life right now, or just the easiest?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you skip gym this time because it’s the best day to take a break and let your body rest and restore, or because it’s raining outside?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you didn’t get that job, it doesn’t seem that great, is it because didn’t actually want it anyway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And be suspicious when your explanations conveniently happen to give you the permission to do the thing you wanted to do before coming up with them, or make you feel better about doing/believing things that you like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do keep your religion because it’s a “good moral guidance”, because it makes sense, or because your parents believed in it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you defending piracy because “it actually helps companies to promote their content, so it’s not a big deal, also information should be free”, or because it’s really convenient to watch a free movie?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your city or country actually the best place in the world, or do you like it because you were born here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also notice that when you are looking for answers that you don’t already know, you feel curious, you are craving to know the answer, yet rationalization usually makes you more confident/comfortable/justified.&lt;/p&gt;

Should you go or not?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’ve been planning to go see a movie this Friday, and have already bought a ticket, but now that it’s time to go out you realize that you don’t want to go, and that you would rather enjoy spending your evening at home. Should you go or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people say yes, after all, the ticket has already been paid for, and it’s nonrefundable, so you wouldn’t want it to be wasted, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is called a Sunk Cost Fallacy — the ​idea that people tend to stick with the courses of action they have ​invested ​money, ​time, or ​effort in, ​even when continuing is not the best thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, it’s irrational to let the costs that we can’t recover to influence our decisions, only future costs and benefits should matter. But we don’t want to admit our mistakes, to “waste” our investment, so we often stick by our past choices that continue costing us more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie example may not make it seem like a big deal, but this fallacy often leads to more significant consequences. Many people stick with professions they dislike because they have spent that all this money and time on getting their degree. They often don’t consider that starting over is better than being miserable for the rest of your career. Or people stay in unhappy relationships because of all the time they have invested in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this fallacy — be aware of it, ask yourself where do I fall victim to it. Learn to recognize it, and once you do —admit that it’s irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often commit this fallacy not because they think it’s logical, but because they are emotionally invested in the effort they put in, so you need to understand that sometimes it’s better to let go. Imagine that you’ve just been dropped into your current life situation with no warning, and do what is in your best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have realized half way through reading a book that it’s not useful or interesting — give it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you trying to finish eating this sandwich because it’s already been paid for, even though you’re not hungry? Throw it away, it doesn’t benefit anybody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you keep going to a bad/useless class that you’ve paid a lot of money for? You probably don’t need to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you put so much sweat in writing this scene in your screenplay, only to realize that it doesn’t make the movie better? Cut it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I don’t mean to say that you should be wasteful, it’s always wise to try anticipating such things in advance and to avoid doing them in the first place. But once you did, don’t spend even more energy on it, realize that putting more time into it wont make it more worth it, cut your losses, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t get your money, energy and time back, but you can still make yourself happier.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Confirmation Bias</title><link href="/post/confirmation-bias" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-03T00:04:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-04-03T00:04:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-04-03:/post/confirmation-bias</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We jump to conclusions, and then look for information that confirms our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your elbow is itchy, and you are starting to fear that it might be serious. You type in google “itchy elbow, serious symptom”, and in 20 minutes you are convinced that you have elbow cancer, space AIDS, and a severe case of acute ladidadidosis. The more you search, the more certain you are of your impending doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion, you may type “dolphins are racist”, and find out all about dolphins being the secret force behind holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily find a confirmation for any belief, and people often do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to look for information that confirms our beliefs.&lt;/strong&gt; We jump to conclusions, assume that our initial guess is correct, and then look for evidence that supports it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is called &lt;strong&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/strong&gt;, and it has many effects that prevent us from being more intelligent and developing accurate beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We set higher standards for evidence that disagrees with our ideas.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if you don’t believe in evolution, you may say that this is because there’s a gap in the fossils between monkeys and humans, and so there’s not enough evidence to prove that evolution is true. At the same time, you may have no problem taking an old book and the words of a priest as a convncing support for your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When information is ambiguous, we tend to interpret it as supporting our existing position.&lt;/strong&gt; Lets say someone was rude to you the first time youve met, then the next time he does something nice, you may think that he’s just being manipulative or wants something from you, so you become even more convinced that this is a bad person. On the other hand if the first time you’ve met someone he was nice, and is now he’s acting like a jerk, you may just assume that he’s simply having a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, we remember things selectively — facts that prove us right are easier to recall.&lt;/strong&gt; People who believe in horoscopes, probably do that because they can easily remember all the times horoscopes were right, and forget or ignore countless times they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome confirmation bias, try to balance the sources you get your information from, to look at the both sides of the argument, think about what kind of evidence would disprove your theory, and actively search for things that challenge your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>What are Cognitive Biases?</title><link href="/post/what-are-cognitive-biases" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-03T00:03:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-04-03T00:03:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-04-03:/post/what-are-cognitive-biases</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our brain takes mental shortcuts that distort our picture of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-1.png"&gt;
Imagine you have a basket of fruits(apples and oranges), you reach out, take one at random, and eat it. Then you decide you’re hungry, and eat a few more. At that point you realize that you ate like 5 apples and only one orange, so you think that there’s way more apples in there. Makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-2.png"&gt;
Now you reach into a different basket, and grab a bunch of berries —5 strawberries and 10 blueberries. Should you think that there’s 2 times more blueberries here? Not really, because strawberries are bigger and heavier, so there’s more of them at the bottom of the basket than at the top, and your estimate would be biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called statistical bias. When your information is skewed, you form an inaccurate picture of the world. You could try to gather more data, but it wouldn’t help, because the way you gather it is fundamentally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now imagine you reach into the third basket, and holy shit! — it’s dollar bills! You’re rich, you’ll finally be able to buy your own giraffe, you always wanted one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you notice that some of the bills are $100, and other’s are only $5. But you think most of bills in the bag are probably $100, right? I mean you really wish they were, after all, giraffes are expensive, and you don’t want to settle for buying some lame capybara at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-6.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case your expectation is incorrect not because you have wrong information, but because it’s influenced by a different kind of bias — a cognitive bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-7.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our brain does not have the time and energy to accurately process all the information it perceives, it takes mental shortcuts(called heuristics). Most of the time they are useful, but often they mislead us and result in systematic errors in our thinking — that is what cognitive biases are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-8.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like statistical biases, cognitive biases distort your picture of the world, and when your method of learning about the world is flawed, gathering more information will not help to correct the error, in fact it can even worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These biases prevent us from having accurate beliefs, making good decisions, and achieving our goals. Sometimes they result in small mistakes(like losing some money by playing a lottery), sometimes mistakes are not so small(burning witches, holocaust, me watching Star Wars prequels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-9.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive biases are not a result of being an unfair or a dishonest person, they are not committed by choice, they are a fundamental property of how humans think, they are flaws in the lens through which we look at the world. Being biased is like having a miscalibrated measuring instrument, except in this case the instrument is your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-10.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we fix it? Instead of relying on our natural hunches and intuitions, we can learn to recognize our mistakes, and then use superior tools(rationality and logic) to correct them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is to learn about the types of biases, fallacies, and the cognitive tools we can use to prevent them, which is what this series of posts is about.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
