&lt;p&gt;Learning web development is a huge advantage for a founder, even understanding
the basics will be extremely useful. This post will give you a high-level
overview of everything you need to learn, a roadmap for getting started, and a
collection of the best resources you can use to learn quickly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am going to tell you everything a professional full-stack web developer needs
to know, but if you’re only interested in understanding the basics — you can
stop reading after “Domain names and Hosting” section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Foundations (HTML/CSS/JS)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to begin is by learning the 3 main technologies all websites are
made of. HTML defines the content of a website, CSS specifies how it
looks(fonts/colors/images/etc), and JavaScript allows you to dynamically
manipulate elements(everything interactive you see on the internet was made
using JS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-2-html-js-css.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn the basics is to go through &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"&gt;The Web Developer Bootcamp on
Udemy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take you through the process of creating your first website, and give
you a great place to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frameworks are tools that allow you to implement all the common functionality
much faster and easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend using frameworks as early as possible, because they will enable you
to get results much faster, and at the same time will teach you the best
practices in a very natural and intuitive way. Just by using frameworks, you
will absorb a huge amount of knowledge incredibly quickly, and avoid wasting
time on anything unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In web development, there’s always an enormous amount of technologies to choose
from, and that choice can often be difficult for the novice. For the rest of the
article I will spare you the confusion, and instead of listing pros and cons of
every option, I’ll just tell you the best things to use based on my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-3-responsive.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to get started is learning &lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt;. These
are by far the most popular frameworks that are used by the vast majority of the
websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt; is a CSS framework, that gives you a bunch of easily customizable
interface elements, and allows you to create responsive websites very quickly
(responsive means they look well on mobile devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap has recently released the new version, and you can get started with it
by following &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/"&gt;this course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt; is a JavaScript framework, that significantly simplifies the way you
manipulate webpage elements. It has an enormous amount of plugins for every
conceivable purpose, so whenever you need some interactive element, you can be
sure you will find a way to create it with jQuery. It will also be very easy,
because StackOverflow already has solutions to 95% of the issues you will
encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-4-jquery.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn the fundamentals, you can just watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWXggB-T1jQ"&gt;this excellent
lecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the sake of completeness, I should mention
&lt;a href="http://compass-style.org/"&gt;Compass&lt;/a&gt;. You don’t need to think about it at the
very beginning, because it’s not essential for your ability to make websites,
but when you reach a point where you’re writing a lot of intermediate/advanced
CSS, and begin to find it a bit tedious, you should definitely keep it in mind.
Compass makes the process of writing CSS &lt;strong&gt;way &lt;/strong&gt;faster and more enjoyable, so
if you can invest a couple of hours into learning that, that will be one of the
best productivity boosters you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is the world’s most popular content
management system. If you are not a technical person, and are just looking to
quickly get started with making an easily customizable website — you just learn
to install and use WordPress, and that’s pretty much it, you don’t need to look
any further. It has an infinite amount of themes and plugins that will cover 90%
of your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-5-wordpress.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in becoming more of a professional web developer, and
learning to create your own custom websites, you might want to skip it and learn
a backend framework(I’ll describe them in the following sections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Domain Names and Hosting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have learned the basics and have built your first website, naturally
you want to make it available to the world. Again, in the interest of saving you
hours of research, I will not list hundreds of available options, and just tell
you the “right” things to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-6-hosting.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To buy domain names you will use &lt;a href="https://www.namecheap.com/"&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt;.
As the name implies, it has very good prices, and also an excellent user
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To host your first pages, you should use &lt;a href="https://www.bluehost.com/"&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt;,
it is cheap, very easy to use, has excellent documentation and a lot of
automated tools. It makes installing WordPress or hosting simple html pages
extremely easy, so if your goal is to get started quickly — that is exactly what
you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you will go further and gain more skill — you will need a
VPS(virtual private server). It is, to put it simply, a remote computer you have
the complete control over, and will use to serve the sites you have built with
frameworks. I highly recommend using
&lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;, it has great prices, beautiful
and intuitive interface, and I’ve been happily using it to host all of my
websites for the past 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backend Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have learned the basics, and created several simple websites using
the tools listed above, you can decide to go further, and learn how to
professionally create custom websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, the best place to begin is learning one of the backend frameworks.
Backend frameworks run on server, and dynamically generate html for a website
every time the user visits a url.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, there are dozens of options, but I will help you to narrow it down
to 3 — &lt;strong&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Node/Express&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-7-django.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opinions on which one you should learn first will differ among different
developers, but I strongly recommend you to begin with Django, and then learn
Node/Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major advantage of Django is that it is written in Python — a beautiful,
powerful language that is used in every field you can imagine, and at the same is
time the best choice for your first programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django itself is straightforward, powerful, flexible, has excellent documentation, and all
the tools you’re going to need to build 95% of the websites. More importantly —
it will give you an excellent framework for thinking about the backend code, and
understanding it is an excellent way to learn the core fundamentals of web
development in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite introduction to Django is the TutsPlus course &lt;a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/getting-started-with-django"&gt;Getting Started with Django&lt;/a&gt;, and the best way to go from a beginner to intermediate/advanced is an excellent
book &lt;a href="https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8"&gt;Two Scoops of Django&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFW_fvwCoF44MGWk74U_rFg"&gt;free youtube
tutorials&lt;/a&gt; by Mike
Hibbert’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Node and Express&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node and Express are extremely powerful tools that I recommend you to
learn after Django. They might be a bit tough for a beginner, but if you have an
understanding of Django — you will learn them very quickly and naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-8-node.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node has many advantages, and the best way to experience them is to try it for yourself. Often it will enable you to build websites much quicker than you would with Django, you will understand a lot of backend programming concepts in more depth, have an easier time building APIs, real-time webapps(like a chat or a game), and universal webapps(you'll encounter them when you will learn React). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best course I have encountered is &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2"&gt;The Complete NodeJS Developer Course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Frontend Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand HTML/CSS/JS and one backend framework, you are a capable web
developer with the power to create many kinds of websites. If you want to become
a Full-Stack developer — welcome to the world of frontend frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend frameworks will enable you to create powerful single-page applications.
At this point you’re essentially making an app that runs completely in the
browser, occasionally exchanging data with the server(like Gmail or Trello).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-9-react.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time there has been a lot of competition in this space, but as you’re
reading this article, the best choice is pretty clear — you should learn &lt;strong&gt;React
and Redux&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t go into explaining how they work or what are their advantages(it would
take a long time), but luckily, there’s an absolutely brilliant course that will
teach you everything you need to know - &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/"&gt;Modern React with Redux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to learn more advanced functionality, you can watch the 2nd part of this
course by the same author - &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/learn/v4/"&gt;Advanced React and Redux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of these courses, Stephen Grider, is an absolutely brilliant teacher,
he explains everything incredibly well, and you will have a ton of fun learning
all the complexities of these technologies by following his courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend you to create a website with Node and React/Redux, because
it will really help you to grasp how to create and use REST APIs, and combine
the whole set of technologies into a powerful and useful software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DevOps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pheew, that’s a lot of stuff. The final part of the puzzle a Full-Stack Web
Developer needs to learn is DevOps. It is a deep subject that I’m not an expert
in, but the fundamentals of deploying websites are not that hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-10-devops.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, chances are you have learned a lot of it just by building and deploying
websites. You have probably used github and some CI tool to deploy your
websites, and Nginx to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the big thing you should learn is &lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt;. Docker is an industry
standard for deploying web applications, it makes the whole process fast,
elegant and convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/webdev-roadmap-11-docker.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have learned Docker from &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-tutorial-for-devops-run-docker-containers"&gt;this course&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m very happy with it. This course is short, straightforward, to the point, and easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article was useful to you. Obviously, it’s impossible to cover
everything about this deep, complex, and rapidly evolving field in one article, but
I believe that topics and resources above will give you a clear vision of the
path ahead, and a useful roadmap to follow. At least, this is the kind of
article I wish was available to me a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will certainly learn more as you follow along, and go into depth into the
topics that interest you the most, but I think that now your path will be much more
straightforward and less confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to share with you my favorite takeaways from an amazing &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14146850"&gt;Ask HN
thread&lt;/a&gt;, where technical founders

&lt;h3&gt;Master marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you build it they will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A developer with marketing skills can build products and achieve revenues far in
excess of their skill set. Only 20–40% of running a successful software
development business consists of developing software. A software developer with
complete code and no customers is just a software developer. A business person
with tons of customers and no software/product is in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brand, reputation, and intellectual property are 100x more valuable than
any software or technical feat. Software and technical work is relatively cheap.
It cannot be the basis of your business because someone can come in and clone
your product after you’ve done the hard work of introducing an innovative
product and establishing/educating the market. If another product has only half
of your functionality, but more substantive marketing, it’s more than enough for
them to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understand your customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies fail because they build something no one wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out who you are selling to and what problem you’re solving for them
&lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; you build anything. Forget the code, find market first. Talk to your
customers. Ideally, solve your own problem, but if you are not the target
market, you need to find a product champion who will join your team prior to the
MVP creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do not be seduced by the technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes devs don’t realize that the hardest parts of starting and growing a
business have nothing to do with code or the tech stack you choose. Marketing,
getting and retaining customers and everything else in between is way harder
than writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers don’t care about the shiny new tech, what matters is solving their
problem. Often it is much easier to do with an old and proven technology,
because new tech changes rapidly, is less stable, has less learning resources
and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on your differentiation and competitive advantages, going stock with
&lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delegate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a job application from yourself for each of the jobs.&lt;br&gt; Contemplate why
on earth you would ever hire you for the job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your time is valuable, the time you spend doing a task is the time you can’t
spend doing anything else. So focus on doing things you’re best at, and outsorce
everything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work out exactly what tasks there are in running your business that you are not
an expert at, such as accounting, sales, copy writing, etc. and hire people to
do those parts for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set revenue targets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan for profitability, set goals, and be realistic about whether you are
successfully accomplishing them. If you don’t, you might have built a good side
project, but not a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim to get your company to 10k USD monthly product revenue within three months
after launch(that’s basically a limit of ramen profitability for a small team of
2–4, plus a little bit of extra to run the business). If you can’t, then either
the product, target market or team needs to be revised drastically. It’s not a
hard goal, but it’s a great way to frame the product launch by forcing you to
ask hard questions about what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also useful as a pricing yardstick early on. If you have very few
customers, they need to be paying enough that you reach $10k almost immediately.
If your product isn’t worth that much, then you need to scale out. It’s best to
figure this out right from the start. If it feels like you can’t do $10k MRR in
three months on your own, then you need to find a cofounder who can do it
together with you… So it’s a good way to calibrate cofounder expectations as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build an MVP.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build the smallest viable version of your product and test it as early as
possible, get it in front of customers as quickly as you can and get them to pay
you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, all you need is a landing page to measure the interest. Create a static
website describing problem and the solution, with a signup, using Google Adwords
and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skip everything nonessential at the start. Focus on the key features that
customers will pay for. It will feel broken, but it’s only broken if you can’t
get any customers. When you find the right product formula and need to scale,
you’ll probably need to refactor or rewrite large parts of it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do things that don’t scale. Don’t future proof your MVP, just make it so you can
validate that your product has a market beyond your product champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other great points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being good at talking to people and networking is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good reputation and word-of-mouth is better than buying the #1 spot on
Adwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire bad clients. They aren’t worth the stress, frustration, and opportunity
cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to say “no” to feature requests that don’t fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget to take care of yourself. &lt;br&gt; It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
Sleep, exercise, eat healthy food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient. It will take longer than you think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on your process. Doing an hour of client works earns you one hour of
revenue. Improving your agency processes can earn you a large multiple of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how to sell again and again to the same customers, otherwise you will
have a high cost of customer acquisition. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t let a single customer account for more than 10% of your revenue. If that
customer leaves, you’ll be in a painful situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks will loan you money when you don’t need it and won’t loan money when you
do need it. Apply for a loan or line of credit when you’re flush with cash in
case of a rainy day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hire too quickly. Payroll + benefits can eat through profits like crazy in
a software business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build simple products that do one thing well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t take money from anyone who can’t afford to lose it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hire a ‘marketing’ firm. They will charge 10’s of thousands of dollars to
ask you questions like ‘What do you think we should do?’ and then feed it back
to you. If the product is positioned well with customers, you know more than the
marketing company ever will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failures (at least small ones) are not a problem. Failing to recover is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start now, you’ll never feel ready. Just go, learn, and repeat. Action is king.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of software for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s keyword research tools, rank tracking tools, competition analysis tools,
backlink building tools, on page SEO plugins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them have free tiers that you can use for free, and if you’re doing SEO
just for one website, it’s most likely that you will not need to pay for any of
them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of software for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s keyword research tools, rank tracking tools, competition analysis tools,
backlink building tools, on page SEO plugins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them have free tiers that you can use for free, and if you’re doing SEO
just for one website, it’s most likely that you will not need to pay for any of
them:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use google’s keyword tool + common sense for keyword research(and you can look
up 2 promising keywords per day for free with
&lt;a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/"&gt;KWFinder&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://majestic.com/"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/"&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt; for competition analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://proranktracker.com/"&gt;ProRankTracker&lt;/a&gt; for keyword tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-page SEO is best to do manually, and then use
&lt;a href="https://seositecheckup.com/"&gt;SEOSiteCheckup&lt;/a&gt; to make sure you’ve optimized
everything the best you could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For backlink building you do not need any software, it’s much more efficient to
find someone on &lt;a href="https://www.freelance.com/en/"&gt;Freelance&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://konker.io/"&gt;Konker&lt;/a&gt; to do that for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these tools offer plenty of free functionality, you absolutely do not
need “All in One” toolkit to get started, especially if you’re not offering SEO
service and just trying to rank one website. Once you see the results with free
tools — buy the premium versions for convenience as needed, or don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, I recommend spending most of your budget on buying backlinks and
social signals, because that’s where it matters most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a question I get asked very often, so I’ve decided to share my
collection of the most effective strategies that will help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold emailing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find people in your niche and personally contact them. This is the most
straightforward way to begin, finding people who are likely to need your service
and making a personalized offer is free and very effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Marketing&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Social Media&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a blog or make a YouTube channel, share free value, submit links to Hacker
News or subreddits, use your posts to advertise your service’s landing page.
This can be combined with smart PR/Influencer marketing(guest blog for people,
get people to share your content), and SEO(think about long-tail very niche
keywords that you can rank for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering as marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create open source or free software that your potential clients will want to
use, use it to drive traffic to your page. Look at
&lt;a href="https://www.draw.io/"&gt;draw.io&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://chapp.is/"&gt;chapp.is&lt;/a&gt; for a great
example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook ads may not be the best long term strategy, but they are an excellent
way to quickly test your landing page and see how well it converts. Target
audience in your niche, make an appealing ad, and spend a few buck sending
traffic to your page, it’s very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find people who already have clients, and offer them to work on projects
together(for example you can contact app designers and offer them development
services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referrals and word of mouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a chicken and the egg problem at the beginning, but after you
have your first clients, they might bring more business or recommend more
clients. Consider giving people heavy discounts at the beginning, if you think
they will bring you more business in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Future&lt;/a&gt;”, a brilliant lecture by
Alan Kay at Startup School:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus not just on problem solving, but on problem finding. You can be sure that
95% of everything we do is wrong, inefficient, and will be changed in the
future, but it’s hard to see that from now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of innovating out from the present, invent the future from the future.
Imagine the world 30 years from now. Think “Wouldn’t it be ridiculous if we
didn’t have this?”. Take this initial glimmer of an idea so far out that you
don’t have to worry how you get there. Then bring it back closer to the present,
identify an achievable and realistic step towards it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to see technology of today as the punch card machines in the 70s, and try to
replace them with Apple II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; advance something &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; important. Something worth
dedicating your life to. Pursue grand visions, not goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it is difficult, focus on milestones, not deadlines. Deadlines can be
missed, and are hard to set up realistically when you’re doing something that’s
never been done before. Milestones are inspiring to reach, and it’s more
encouraging to go from one milestone to another in pursuit of a long term goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about having the perfect batting average. Total number of successes
matters, not success/failure ratio. Failure is just overhead — an expected cost
of trying to do hard things.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of a keyword depends on how much competition there is for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if there are a lot of high authority websites spending money on SEO
for a certain keyword, you won’t be able to compete with them. That’s why you
should look for long tail keywords with low competition, but high search volume.&lt;/p&gt;

for a certain keyword, you won’t be able to compete with them. That’s why you
should look for long tail keywords with low competition, but high search volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To determine keyword’s difficulty, type it in google, and analyze the websites
you see on the first page. Use &lt;a href="https://majestic.com/"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; to look at
their most powerful backlinks, and use &lt;a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/"&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt;
to check their domain and page authority. Or you can use more expensive tools
like &lt;a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/"&gt;Kwfinder&lt;/a&gt; to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the domain of a search result has more Domain Authority than your website,
and more powerful backlinks, and the keyword you’re targeting in the title —
that means it will be difficult to compete with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s no exact match keywords in titles, or the top results have weak DA
and backlinks — that means that nobody is trying to rank for this keyword, and
you can easily do that yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/laptop-spaceship.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re serious about this — I highly recommend you to &lt;strong&gt;learn programming&lt;/strong&gt;.
It’s not impossible to start an online business without it, but you will be at a
pretty big disadvantage, unless you’re planning some purely non-technical
info-product or coaching stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with HTML, CSS, JS at a bare minimum, and if you like it — learn Django or
Node, and possibly React. Those will enable you to build your own software
products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out YCombinator &lt;strong&gt;Startup School&lt;/strong&gt; to learn the fundamentals of creating
and running a technology company. Check out &lt;strong&gt;Alex Becker&lt;/strong&gt;’s YouTube videos to
learn about SEO and Internet Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Hacker News and just hang out there, learn from the community, and be on
top of the developments in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read autobiographies&lt;/strong&gt; of awesome founders and books on how the biggest
companies were made. Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Alexis Ohanian, Amazon(The
Everything Store), Google(In the Plex), YCombinator(The Launch Pad),
Pixar(Creativity, Inc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick the top 3 books for getting started it would be “&lt;strong&gt;Start Small,
Stay Small&lt;/strong&gt;”, “&lt;strong&gt;Rework&lt;/strong&gt;”, and “&lt;strong&gt;Lean Startup&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, most importantly — just &lt;strong&gt;start building something&lt;/strong&gt;, the sooner the
better. You won’t know what you’re doing, but that’s okay, because experimenting
and seeing what works is the fastest way to learn and gain experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to reinvent the wheel, just pick a business model that already works,
copy it, and learn to make it work for you. Here’s a few ideas for getting
started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Affiliate marketing&lt;/strong&gt;. Pick a niche, create an optin, build a mailing
list, sell affiliate products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Marketing &lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt; Social Media &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; SEO&lt;/strong&gt;. Build a blog or a youtube
channel, learn to drive traffic to it, monetize it with affiliate products, try
to figure out how to make your own product to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Info Product&lt;/strong&gt; — create an ebook or a video course and try to sell it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SaaS&lt;/strong&gt; — create an online tool or an app, market it, sell it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; — pick a thing you’re good at, and offer to do it for people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical product&lt;/strong&gt; — look into shopify+ dropshipping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So choose one of these options, make your first website, dive deep, and make it
work. Good luck! =)&lt;/p&gt;
