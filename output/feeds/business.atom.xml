In fincance, &amp;quot;arbitrage&amp;quot; means buying and selling things in different markets to take the advantage of difference in price. Like buying a toy in India for $15, and then selling it for $25 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, you can arbitrage not just products, but also information, knowledge, skill, or even human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say you have met two amazing people who don't know each other. When you introduce them to each other, you generate a massive amount of value for both of them essentially out of nothing - you have given each of them a gift of knowing someone great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example, is arbitraging information. Eliezer Yudkowsky have learned a lot about rationality and human biases from the books he has read, and then parlayed it into his blog, and later a Harry Potter fanfiction - and that has generated a huge amount of value to the people on the internet, who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I figured out that you can take the essays he wrote, and produce short entertaining videos out of them - that way you are exposing the same ideas to a whole new audience, and that, again, generates huge amounts of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also arbitrage skills. That simply means applying good ideas you have learned in one field to a completely different one. I'm constantly applying the skills and ideas I've learned as a 3D artist to my programming process, and, surprisingly, the ideas I've learned from programming are making me a much better artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an unexpected idea that I have discovered, is that you can arbitrage fiction tropes. You can take a trope you have seen in one story, apply it to a completely different genre, and it will create a new and interesting idea. You can take a scifi trope and set it in a fantasy world, or you can take a plot structure from a dramatic tv show and use it in your comedy script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart ideas are often universal. Learn a mental pattern in one field - and apply it elsewhere. Now that I got pretty good at it, every time I have an epiphany in one of my crafts, I intentionally go through each of the other fields I'm interested in and apply it there.  This has helped me to generate a lot of very interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Business advice for software developers</title><link href="/post/business-advice-for-software-developers" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-08-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-08-15:/post/business-advice-for-software-developers</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/startup-insights.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to share with you my favorite takeaways from an amazing &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14146850"&gt;Ask HN
thread&lt;/a&gt;, where technical founders
shared the most important things they have learned from building a business.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Master marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you build it they will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A developer with marketing skills can build products and achieve revenues far in
excess of their skill set. Only 20–40% of running a successful software
development business consists of developing software. A software developer with
complete code and no customers is just a software developer. A business person
with tons of customers and no software/product is in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brand, reputation, and intellectual property are 100x more valuable than
any software or technical feat. Software and technical work is relatively cheap.
It cannot be the basis of your business because someone can come in and clone
your product after you’ve done the hard work of introducing an innovative
product and establishing/educating the market. If another product has only half
of your functionality, but more substantive marketing, it’s more than enough for
them to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understand your customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies fail because they build something no one wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out who you are selling to and what problem you’re solving for them
&lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; you build anything. Forget the code, find market first. Talk to your
customers. Ideally, solve your own problem, but if you are not the target
market, you need to find a product champion who will join your team prior to the
MVP creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do not be seduced by the technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes devs don’t realize that the hardest parts of starting and growing a
business have nothing to do with code or the tech stack you choose. Marketing,
getting and retaining customers and everything else in between is way harder
than writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers don’t care about the shiny new tech, what matters is solving their
problem. Often it is much easier to do with an old and proven technology,
because new tech changes rapidly, is less stable, has less learning resources
and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on your differentiation and competitive advantages, going stock with
&lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delegate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a job application from yourself for each of the jobs.&lt;br&gt; Contemplate why
on earth you would ever hire you for the job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your time is valuable, the time you spend doing a task is the time you can’t
spend doing anything else. So focus on doing things you’re best at, and outsorce
everything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work out exactly what tasks there are in running your business that you are not
an expert at, such as accounting, sales, copy writing, etc. and hire people to
do those parts for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set revenue targets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan for profitability, set goals, and be realistic about whether you are
successfully accomplishing them. If you don’t, you might have built a good side
project, but not a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim to get your company to 10k USD monthly product revenue within three months
after launch(that’s basically a limit of ramen profitability for a small team of
2–4, plus a little bit of extra to run the business). If you can’t, then either
the product, target market or team needs to be revised drastically. It’s not a
hard goal, but it’s a great way to frame the product launch by forcing you to
ask hard questions about what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also useful as a pricing yardstick early on. If you have very few
customers, they need to be paying enough that you reach $10k almost immediately.
If your product isn’t worth that much, then you need to scale out. It’s best to
figure this out right from the start. If it feels like you can’t do $10k MRR in
three months on your own, then you need to find a cofounder who can do it
together with you… So it’s a good way to calibrate cofounder expectations as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build an MVP.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build the smallest viable version of your product and test it as early as
possible, get it in front of customers as quickly as you can and get them to pay
you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, all you need is a landing page to measure the interest. Create a static
website describing problem and the solution, with a signup, using Google Adwords
and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skip everything nonessential at the start. Focus on the key features that
customers will pay for. It will feel broken, but it’s only broken if you can’t
get any customers. When you find the right product formula and need to scale,
you’ll probably need to refactor or rewrite large parts of it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do things that don’t scale. Don’t future proof your MVP, just make it so you can
validate that your product has a market beyond your product champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other great points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being good at talking to people and networking is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good reputation and word-of-mouth is better than buying the #1 spot on
Adwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire bad clients. They aren’t worth the stress, frustration, and opportunity
cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to say “no” to feature requests that don’t fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget to take care of yourself. &lt;br&gt; It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
Sleep, exercise, eat healthy food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient. It will take longer than you think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on your process. Doing an hour of client works earns you one hour of
revenue. Improving your agency processes can earn you a large multiple of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how to sell again and again to the same customers, otherwise you will
have a high cost of customer acquisition. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t let a single customer account for more than 10% of your revenue. If that
customer leaves, you’ll be in a painful situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks will loan you money when you don’t need it and won’t loan money when you
do need it. Apply for a loan or line of credit when you’re flush with cash in
case of a rainy day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hire too quickly. Payroll + benefits can eat through profits like crazy in
a software business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build simple products that do one thing well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t take money from anyone who can’t afford to lose it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hire a ‘marketing’ firm. They will charge 10’s of thousands of dollars to
ask you questions like ‘What do you think we should do?’ and then feed it back
to you. If the product is positioned well with customers, you know more than the
marketing company ever will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failures (at least small ones) are not a problem. Failing to recover is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start now, you’ll never feel ready. Just go, learn, and repeat. Action is king.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of software for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s keyword research tools, rank tracking tools, competition analysis tools,
backlink building tools, on page SEO plugins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them have free tiers that you can use for free, and if you’re doing SEO
just for one website, it’s most likely that you will not need to pay for any of
them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of them have free tiers that you can use for free, and if you’re doing SEO
just for one website, it’s most likely that you will not need to pay for any of
them:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use google’s keyword tool + common sense for keyword research(and you can look
up 2 promising keywords per day for free with
&lt;a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/"&gt;KWFinder&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://majestic.com/"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/"&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt; for competition analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://proranktracker.com/"&gt;ProRankTracker&lt;/a&gt; for keyword tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-page SEO is best to do manually, and then use
&lt;a href="https://seositecheckup.com/"&gt;SEOSiteCheckup&lt;/a&gt; to make sure you’ve optimized
everything the best you could.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For backlink building you do not need any software, it’s much more efficient to
find someone on &lt;a href="https://www.freelance.com/en/"&gt;Freelance&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://konker.io/"&gt;Konker&lt;/a&gt; to do that for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these tools offer plenty of free functionality, you absolutely do not
need “All in One” toolkit to get started, especially if you’re not offering SEO
service and just trying to rank one website. Once you see the results with free
tools — buy the premium versions for convenience as needed, or don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, I recommend spending most of your budget on buying backlinks and
social signals, because that’s where it matters most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a question I get asked very often, so I’ve decided to share my
collection of the most effective strategies that will help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold emailing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find people in your niche and personally contact them. This is the most
straightforward way to begin, finding people who are likely to need your service
and making a personalized offer is free and very effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Marketing&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Social Media&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a blog or make a YouTube channel, share free value, submit links to Hacker
News or subreddits, use your posts to advertise your service’s landing page.
This can be combined with smart PR/Influencer marketing(guest blog for people,
get people to share your content), and SEO(think about long-tail very niche
keywords that you can rank for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering as marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create open source or free software that your potential clients will want to
use, use it to drive traffic to your page. Look at
&lt;a href="https://www.draw.io/"&gt;draw.io&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://chapp.is/"&gt;chapp.is&lt;/a&gt; for a great
example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook ads may not be the best long term strategy, but they are an excellent
way to quickly test your landing page and see how well it converts. Target
audience in your niche, make an appealing ad, and spend a few buck sending
traffic to your page, it’s very easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find people who already have clients, and offer them to work on projects
together(for example you can contact app designers and offer them development
services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referrals and word of mouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a chicken and the egg problem at the beginning, but after you
have your first clients, they might bring more business or recommend more
clients. Consider giving people heavy discounts at the beginning, if you think
they will bring you more business in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s notes are from “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id1WShzzMCQ"&gt;How to Invent the
Future&lt;/a&gt;”, a brilliant lecture by
Alan Kay at Startup School:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus not just on problem solving, but on problem finding. You can be sure that
95% of everything we do is wrong, inefficient, and will be changed in the
future, but it’s hard to see that from now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of innovating out from the present, invent the future from the future.
Imagine the world 30 years from now. Think “Wouldn’t it be ridiculous if we
didn’t have this?”. Take this initial glimmer of an idea so far out that you
don’t have to worry how you get there. Then bring it back closer to the present,
identify an achievable and realistic step towards it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to see technology of today as the punch card machines in the 70s, and try to
replace them with Apple II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; advance something &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; important. Something worth
dedicating your life to. Pursue grand visions, not goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it is difficult, focus on milestones, not deadlines. Deadlines can be
missed, and are hard to set up realistically when you’re doing something that’s
never been done before. Milestones are inspiring to reach, and it’s more
encouraging to go from one milestone to another in pursuit of a long term goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about having the perfect batting average. Total number of successes
matters, not success/failure ratio. Failure is just overhead — an expected cost
of trying to do hard things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><category term="freelance"></category></entry><entry><title>What is the meaning of difficulty level for a keyword in SEO?</title><link href="/post/keyword-difficulty" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-14T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-08-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-08-14:/post/keyword-difficulty</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/startup-advice.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of a keyword depends on how much competition there is for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if there are a lot of high authority websites spending money on SEO
for a certain keyword, you won’t be able to compete with them. That’s why you
should look for long tail keywords with low competition, but high search volume.&lt;/p&gt;

for a certain keyword, you won’t be able to compete with them. That’s why you
should look for long tail keywords with low competition, but high search volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To determine keyword’s difficulty, type it in google, and analyze the websites
you see on the first page. Use &lt;a href="https://majestic.com/"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; to look at
their most powerful backlinks, and use &lt;a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/"&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt;
to check their domain and page authority. Or you can use more expensive tools
like &lt;a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/"&gt;Kwfinder&lt;/a&gt; to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the domain of a search result has more Domain Authority than your website,
and more powerful backlinks, and the keyword you’re targeting in the title —
that means it will be difficult to compete with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s no exact match keywords in titles, or the top results have weak DA
and backlinks — that means that nobody is trying to rank for this keyword, and
you can easily do that yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/laptop-spaceship.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re serious about this — I highly recommend you to &lt;strong&gt;learn programming&lt;/strong&gt;.
It’s not impossible to start an online business without it, but you will be at a
pretty big disadvantage, unless you’re planning some purely non-technical
info-product or coaching stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with HTML, CSS, JS at a bare minimum, and if you like it — learn Django or
Node, and possibly React. Those will enable you to build your own software
products.&lt;/p&gt;

learn about SEO and Internet Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Hacker News and just hang out there, learn from the community, and be on
top of the developments in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read autobiographies&lt;/strong&gt; of awesome founders and books on how the biggest
companies were made. Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Alexis Ohanian, Amazon(The
Everything Store), Google(In the Plex), YCombinator(The Launch Pad),
Pixar(Creativity, Inc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick the top 3 books for getting started it would be “&lt;strong&gt;Start Small,
Stay Small&lt;/strong&gt;”, “&lt;strong&gt;Rework&lt;/strong&gt;”, and “&lt;strong&gt;Lean Startup&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, most importantly — just &lt;strong&gt;start building something&lt;/strong&gt;, the sooner the
better. You won’t know what you’re doing, but that’s okay, because experimenting
and seeing what works is the fastest way to learn and gain experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to reinvent the wheel, just pick a business model that already works,
copy it, and learn to make it work for you. Here’s a few ideas for getting
started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Affiliate marketing&lt;/strong&gt;. Pick a niche, create an optin, build a mailing
list, sell affiliate products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Marketing &lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt; Social Media &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; SEO&lt;/strong&gt;. Build a blog or a youtube
channel, learn to drive traffic to it, monetize it with affiliate products, try
to figure out how to make your own product to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Info Product&lt;/strong&gt; — create an ebook or a video course and try to sell it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SaaS&lt;/strong&gt; — create an online tool or an app, market it, sell it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; — pick a thing you’re good at, and offer to do it for people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical product&lt;/strong&gt; — look into shopify+ dropshipping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So choose one of these options, make your first website, dive deep, and make it
work. Good luck! =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my reply to a person who asked this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read PG’s essay on coming up with startup ideas (&lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"&gt;http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&lt;/a&gt;) and books on startups (Start Small Stay Small, Lean Startup, Rework, Zero to One, Abundance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Edward DeBono’s “Serious Creativity” — the most brilliant book about generating ideas I’ve ever encountered. Not about startups or apps in particular, but very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are startup ideas threads on HN: 
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9836508"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9836508&lt;/a&gt; 
and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re good at android development — please, PLEASE build a good text editor. It is the most important app for me, the first thing I look for in any new device, and all android text editors suck SO MUCH. I would easily spend 10−30 if you would build something like Editorial, that would be convenient to use on android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think if there’s something in your life that’s missing, some tool that you would like to use, and build that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that fails — think about the perfect niche, about people you like and respect, who use technology and/or could benefit from it; understand them deeply, identify their goals, problems, challenges; and build something for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that fails — look for a different not tech-related hobby. Like music or writing or woodworking or something like that. Whatever makes you the most curious. That will help you with burnout, and will give you a great niche to work in. Then identify the problems you’re facing, and solve them with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that fails — talk to other people and ask if there’s anything they might need, if there’s any problems they have, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also — check out new mobile OS’es, like Ubuntu Touch, Firefox OS, etc. These are new, emerging ecosystems, where there’s plenty of apps to build. You can simply look at the most successful iOS/Android apps, and copy them to these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
