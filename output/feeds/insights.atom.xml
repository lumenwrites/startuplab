&lt;p&gt;Today’s notes are from “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id1WShzzMCQ"&gt;How to Invent the
Future&lt;/a&gt;”, a brilliant lecture by
Alan Kay at Startup School:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus not just on problem solving, but on problem finding. You can be sure that
95% of everything we do is wrong, inefficient, and will be changed in the
future, but it’s hard to see that from now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of innovating out from the present, invent the future from the future.
Imagine the world 30 years from now. Think “Wouldn’t it be ridiculous if we
didn’t have this?”. Take this initial glimmer of an idea so far out that you
don’t have to worry how you get there. Then bring it back closer to the present,
identify an achievable and realistic step towards it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to see technology of today as the punch card machines in the 70s, and try to
replace them with Apple II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; advance something &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; important. Something worth
dedicating your life to. Pursue grand visions, not goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it is difficult, focus on milestones, not deadlines. Deadlines can be
missed, and are hard to set up realistically when you’re doing something that’s
never been done before. Milestones are inspiring to reach, and it’s more
encouraging to go from one milestone to another in pursuit of a long term goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about having the perfect batting average. Total number of successes
matters, not success/failure ratio. Failure is just overhead — an expected cost
of trying to do hard things.&lt;/li&gt;
