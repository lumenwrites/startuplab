	<a href="/post/value-arbitrage"><h1>Value Arbitrage</h1></a>
	<p>This is an extremely useful idea that I've learned just recently. In fincance, &quot;arbitrage&quot; means buying and selling things in different markets to take the advantage of difference in price. Like buying a toy in India for $15, and then selling it for $25 in the US.</p>
<p>Turns out, you can arbitrage not just products, but also information, knowledge, skill, or even human relationships.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you have met two amazing people who don't know each other. When you introduce them to each other, you generate a massive amount of value for both of them essentially out of nothing - you have given each of them a gift of knowing someone great.</p>
<p>Another example, is arbitraging information. Eliezer Yudkowsky have learned a lot about rationality and human biases from the books he has read, and then parlayed it into his blog, and later a Harry Potter fanfiction - and that has generated a huge amount of value to the people on the internet, who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise.</p>
<p>Similarly, I figured out that you can take the essays he wrote, and produce short entertaining videos out of them - that way you are exposing the same ideas to a whole new audience, and that, again, generates huge amounts of value.</p>
<p>You can also arbitrage skills. That simply means applying good ideas you have learned in one field to a completely different one. I'm constantly applying the skills and ideas I've learned as a 3D artist to my programming process, and, surprisingly, the ideas I've learned from programming are making me a much better artist.</p>
<p>Finally, an unexpected idea that I have discovered, is that you can arbitrage fiction tropes. You can take a trope you have seen in one story, apply it to a completely different genre, and it will create a new and interesting idea. You can take a scifi trope and set it in a fantasy world, or you can take a plot structure from a dramatic tv show and use it in your comedy script.</p>
<p>Smart ideas are often universal. Learn a mental pattern in one field - and apply it elsewhere. Now that I got pretty good at it, every time I have an epiphany in one of my crafts, I intentionally go through each of the other fields I'm interested in and apply it there.  This has helped me to generate a lot of very interesting ideas.</p>
