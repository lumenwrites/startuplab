<h3></h3>
<p>Today I want to share with you my favorite takeaways from an amazing <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14146850">Ask HN
thread</a>, where technical founders
shared the most important things they have learned from building a business.</p>


<h3>Master marketing</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you build it they will <strong>not</strong> come!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A developer with marketing skills can build products and achieve revenues far in
excess of their skill set. Only 20–40% of running a successful software
development business consists of developing software. A software developer with
complete code and no customers is just a software developer. A business person
with tons of customers and no software/product is in business.</p>
<p>Your brand, reputation, and intellectual property are 100x more valuable than
any software or technical feat. Software and technical work is relatively cheap.
It cannot be the basis of your business because someone can come in and clone
your product after you’ve done the hard work of introducing an innovative
product and establishing/educating the market. If another product has only half
of your functionality, but more substantive marketing, it’s more than enough for
them to win.</p>
<h3>Understand your customers</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Most companies fail because they build something no one wants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figure out who you are selling to and what problem you’re solving for them
<strong>before</strong> you build anything. Forget the code, find market first. Talk to your
customers. Ideally, solve your own problem, but if you are not the target
market, you need to find a product champion who will join your team prior to the
MVP creation.</p>
<h3>Do not be seduced by the technology</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes devs don’t realize that the hardest parts of starting and growing a
business have nothing to do with code or the tech stack you choose. Marketing,
getting and retaining customers and everything else in between is way harder
than writing code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Customers don’t care about the shiny new tech, what matters is solving their
problem. Often it is much easier to do with an old and proven technology,
because new tech changes rapidly, is less stable, has less learning resources
and developers.</p>
<p>Focus on your differentiation and competitive advantages, going stock with
<em>everything</em> else.</p>
<h3>Delegate</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a job application from yourself for each of the jobs.<br> Contemplate why
on earth you would ever hire you for the job!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your time is valuable, the time you spend doing a task is the time you can’t
spend doing anything else. So focus on doing things you’re best at, and outsorce
everything else. </p>
<p>Work out exactly what tasks there are in running your business that you are not
an expert at, such as accounting, sales, copy writing, etc. and hire people to
do those parts for you.</p>
<h3>Set revenue targets</h3>
<p>Plan for profitability, set goals, and be realistic about whether you are
successfully accomplishing them. If you don’t, you might have built a good side
project, but not a startup.</p>
<p>Aim to get your company to 10k USD monthly product revenue within three months
after launch(that’s basically a limit of ramen profitability for a small team of
2–4, plus a little bit of extra to run the business). If you can’t, then either
the product, target market or team needs to be revised drastically. It’s not a
hard goal, but it’s a great way to frame the product launch by forcing you to
ask hard questions about what you’re doing.</p>
<p>It’s also useful as a pricing yardstick early on. If you have very few
customers, they need to be paying enough that you reach $10k almost immediately.
If your product isn’t worth that much, then you need to scale out. It’s best to
figure this out right from the start. If it feels like you can’t do $10k MRR in
three months on your own, then you need to find a cofounder who can do it
together with you… So it’s a good way to calibrate cofounder expectations as
well.</p>
<h3>Build an MVP.</h3>
<p>Build the smallest viable version of your product and test it as early as
possible, get it in front of customers as quickly as you can and get them to pay
you. </p>
<p>Often, all you need is a landing page to measure the interest. Create a static
website describing problem and the solution, with a signup, using Google Adwords
and analytics.</p>
<p>Skip everything nonessential at the start. Focus on the key features that
customers will pay for. It will feel broken, but it’s only broken if you can’t
get any customers. When you find the right product formula and need to scale,
you’ll probably need to refactor or rewrite large parts of it anyway.</p>
<p>Do things that don’t scale. Don’t future proof your MVP, just make it so you can
validate that your product has a market beyond your product champion.</p>
<h3>Other great points</h3>
<ul>
<li>Being good at talking to people and networking is important.</li>
<li>A good reputation and word-of-mouth is better than buying the #1 spot on
Adwords.</li>
<li>Fire bad clients. They aren’t worth the stress, frustration, and opportunity
cost.</li>
<li>Learn to say “no” to feature requests that don’t fit.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to take care of yourself. <br> It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
Sleep, exercise, eat healthy food.</li>
<li>Be patient. It will take longer than you think.</li>
<li>Work on your process. Doing an hour of client works earns you one hour of
revenue. Improving your agency processes can earn you a large multiple of that.</li>
<li>Figure out how to sell again and again to the same customers, otherwise you will
have a high cost of customer acquisition. </li>
<li>Don’t let a single customer account for more than 10% of your revenue. If that
customer leaves, you’ll be in a painful situation.</li>
<li>Banks will loan you money when you don’t need it and won’t loan money when you
do need it. Apply for a loan or line of credit when you’re flush with cash in
case of a rainy day.</li>
<li>Don’t hire too quickly. Payroll + benefits can eat through profits like crazy in
a software business.</li>
<li>Build simple products that do one thing well.</li>
<li>Don’t take money from anyone who can’t afford to lose it</li>
<li>Don’t hire a ‘marketing’ firm. They will charge 10’s of thousands of dollars to
ask you questions like ‘What do you think we should do?’ and then feed it back
to you. If the product is positioned well with customers, you know more than the
marketing company ever will.</li>
<li>Failures (at least small ones) are not a problem. Failing to recover is.</li>
<li>Start now, you’ll never feel ready. Just go, learn, and repeat. Action is king.</li>
